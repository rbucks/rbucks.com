Summary: A cherished family buttermilk waffle recipe from Pinecrest Lake, passed down through generations and perfected over decades.

#### Here’s my family’s secret recipe for buttermilk waffles

Dear internet, here is a treat.

Once upon a time, a long, long, time ago, a relative of mine brought a waffle iron up to ({filename}my-happy-place.md) of the lake in Pinecrest, California. Not knowing what else to make with it, another relative of mine (my grandmother, I’m told), modified a buttermilk waffle recipe and posted it on the inside of a cabinet.

Every year for 34 years I’ve enjoyed these waffles. It’s the hallmark of my summer. I write now, dear internet, to share this goodness with you.

And there it has stayed since long before I was born. You can see the weathering on the scotch tape from decades of summers and winters.

The ingredients are:

1 7/8 cups of flour
2 cups buttermilk
2 teaspoons sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
4 tablespoons melted butter
2 eggs beaten

I once tried to find the recipe online. It’s similar to a Betty Crocker recipe, but like I said, it got modified over the years. Perhaps for the higher elevation, perhaps for the crazy old waffle iron. I don’t know. But you’ll find that these waffles are perfect. Here’s the optimized instructions for how to make them.

- Put all of the dry ingredients into an ancient flour sifter. (You might check in the back of one of your cabinets, behind the navy beans and Quaker Oats). Sift into a large bowl until you have a nice fine powder.

2. Add the buttermilk next. You can get some at the general store on the other side of the lake. Fold it in, don’t beat it. Beating your batter will make your waffles chewy.

3. Add the melted butter. Bacon grease works well too, especially if you have some already cooking behind you.

4. Whisk your eggs into a froth. Hand egg beaters are an excellent choice.

4. Fold in the eggs. Again, don’t over-mix or beat the batter. It’ll take several folds, but your batter is ready as soon as the golden egg froth disappears. Do this part slowly.

5. Set the stage. Melted butter is great for waffle iron preparation.

6. Your waffle batter should fall easily off of a spoon and form patty-like shapes on the waffle iron.

7. Enjoy, of course! You’ll get a feel for when the waffle is at a golden crisp. It just takes practice. Always eat with real butter and maple syrup. Never the fake stuff.
