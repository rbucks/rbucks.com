</footer><!-- /.post-info -->        <p>Here’s a very short story I wrote earlier this year that encapsulates a lot of what 2018 was for me. Some introspection, some awareness of aging, and growth all around me.</p>
<hr>
<p>“How old are you?” she asked.</p>
<p>“36,” I replied. I know where she’s going with this.</p>
<p>“How long until you’ll be 100?”</p>
<p>“A long time.”</p>
<p>“How old will you be after 100?”</p>
<p>“101.”</p>
<p>“And after that?”</p>
<p>“102.” I start to imagine myself here at our old family cabin on Pinecrest Lake when I’m 102. She would be just turning 70. A hazy sadness wafts over me.</p>
<p>“And after that then you’ll die?”</p>
<p>“Yes, probably.” She’s not even four yet. Why is she thinking about this right now?</p>
<p>She rolls over toward me in the tiny wooden bunk where I slept when I was her age and grips my hand. Her fingers are smooth and tiny, soft and warm to the touch. I trace them gently.</p>
<p>“I love you,” she whispers.</p>
<p>“Lily, I love you so much,” I whisper back.</p>
<p>After a few minutes she’s asleep.</p>
