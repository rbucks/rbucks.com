</footer><!-- /.post-info -->        <p>Last week I was on vacation. I go to Pinecrest every year and stay at the cabin my great grandpa built 80 years ago. It’s a special place where life quiets and slows down. It’s the only place where I can very easily turn off the internet.</p>
<p>It’s also a wonderful place to nap.</p>
<p>Naps are the most underrated adult activity. My days as a parent now revolve around nap schedules. Meals, errands, and playtime are timed by the nap.</p>
<p>Why is napping only a province for toddlers? I hearby beckon the return of the nap!</p>
<p>Benefits are many:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stay up later to get that extra reading or writing done- Sleep better when you decide to sleep for the night- Have a high energy afternoon, in which you’re happier and eat less- All the other regular benefits of sleep</li>
</ul>
<p>Napping at work is a taboo. The mid afternoon doldrums hit and instead of napping, I go for a walk, often to get a coffee. Napping for 30 mins would yield better results, but I can’t nap while my colleagues work.</p>
<p>So I’ll have to wait until my office days are over. Then I’ll nap the same time my kids do, and it will be glorious.</p>
