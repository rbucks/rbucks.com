Summary: Making the YIMBY case for mobile homes as part of California's housing solution, covering affordability, ownership, flexibility, and environmental benefits.

Oh, the housing crisis. Let me dip my toe in.

I am a YIMBY. I want to see new housing built close to BART and freeways. I'd much rather see downtowns built up than open spaces built out. Housing has been a problem for years. We've all read about how the high cost of living and a shortage of available housing has left many folks struggling to find affordable places to live. While many factors contribute to the crisis, mobile homes are an interesting part of the solution.

Here are five reasons we should support mobile homes as a solution to the housing crisis in California.

 	- **Cost**: Mobile homes are more affordable than traditional homes, making them an attractive option for people struggling to afford housing in California. With the high cost of living in the state, mobile homes can provide a relatively low-cost alternative that can help ease the burden on people's finances. Cost per square foot of a mobile home is less than one-fifth the cost of a house.
 	- **Ownership**: Since costs are lower, mobile homes offer a pathway to homeownership. I learned in my college political science classes that homeowners are more likely to vote, volunteer in their communities, and participate in public discourse. Plus, they gain the benefits of home equity.
 	- **Flexibility**<span style="font-size: 1rem;">: Mobile homes are prefabricated and can be assembled quickly. They can be deployed quickly to areas that need additional housing. They are also relatively easy to move from one location to another, which provides flexibility in responding to changing housing needs in different counties. With enough warning, mobile homeowners can move their dwellings away from risks of fires and floods.</span>
 	- **Environmental sustainability**: Mobile homes have a smaller environmental footprint compared to traditional homes. They are often built using sustainable materials and are designed to be energy-efficient, which can help reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions.
 	- **Community**: Mobile home parks provide community and belonging for residents. Mobile home parks are built as dense neighborhoods with homes nestled tightly together. This setup helps residents meet and support each other. Some communities offer common facilities like a pool or community center.

I think this is an interesting solution. Land isn't cheap in California, but if we can find a way to produce more mobile, affordable, sustainable homes, it's a step in the right direction. While they are not a complete solution to the complex issue of housing, they offer some benefits that should be considered as part of a comprehensive approach to addressing the housing crisis in California.
