    <p>I never wanted to become a rock star.</p>
<p>I don’t like performing enough, and I didn’t really try to learn to like it. Still, I’m a guitar player, and a pretty darn good one when I’m warmed up and practiced. I like to wonder what it would be like to perform in arenas with a kick-ass rock and roll band. It’s very much a part of who I am, what I like to do, and what I think about.</p>
<p>For example, some people can recall exactly where they were when Lennon and Kennedy were shot. I recall exactly where I was and what I was doing the first time I heard “(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1W2UddURXI)” by John Mayer.</p>
<hr>
<p>I was driving north on the 880 in the East Bay, just up from the Oakland Airport. I had KFOG, a mellow rock station, on the radio, which I listen to in the car when nothing else is good.</p>
<p>The song started. I heard the acoustic intro, a jazzy chord voicing that I didn’t recognize. Usually when I hear a guitar chord I can picture exactly where on the neck it is played. This time I couldn’t, and I was intrigued. A pop song with a complex guitar chord. Tell me more!</p>
<p>His voice enters with the drum kit and bass. He sounds young, and also unique. I figured he was about my age, maybe a little older. As the verse continued I couldn’t make out the chord changes. Was it just a couple notes changing, or was his entire hand moving around the neck? How many chord changes per verse? I couldn’t tell. Usually overly complex chords mean the musician is trying too hard, but this song felt seamless, and the melody line fit the chords really well, despite their complexity. The pre-chorus and chorus had the same affect. Simple, interesting, just kinda perfect. I could tell he was a bad ass guitar player but he also had the sense not to rip into a guitar solo and spoil the vibe of the song. They put a keyboard break in instead. Smart.</p>
<p>Damn, who the hell is this kid?</p>
<p>The tabloids have given John Mayer a rough time, and a lot of that is self-inflicted. However, as a musician and a guitar player, the guy stands out among the best. I’m not impressed by the technical extremists like (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw74sDWPH7U) and (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS_IYe5JTZ4). I never really cared for those players who overly romanticize guitar solos. I don’t like songs that sound like a music theory thesis project.</p>
<p>I admire guitarists whose solos you can sing, who develop real voices in the way they play. I can pick out a solo (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q7Vr3yQYWQ), (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJx5626euOo), (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtLwuPCUEdg), or (http://slash%20november%20rain%20solo) just by listening to the way they strike the string. It’s distinct.</p>
<p>I don’t yet put John Mayer on the same level as those guitarists, but I give him a lot of credit for defining a style of guitar ballad that I’m not sure existed before him. Listen to “(https://g.co/kgs/xtWxH)” from that same debut pop album, “(https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Room_for_Squares).” Then listen to it again. Those guitar chords don’t exist anywhere else.</p>
<p>For that alone, I give the man props, but I also respect his later work. The jazz trio, the country pop album, the Hendrix and Petty covers. I feel like if I was John Mayer, I’d have had the exact same guitar playing career. Oh, and dating Katy Perry? Sure, that too.</p>
<hr>
<p>For the last decade of my life, since I’ve been aware of the guy, there’s been a thread in my brain that feels like I missed out on being John Mayer. The other threads remind me that I don’t have his voice, the guitar chops, the poise on stage, the libido. I would be a terrible John Mayer, and if I could get into his head for a moment, I bet there’s a thread there that wishes he could just have a (https://rbucks.com/2016/03/22/an-ode-to-the-suburbs/) with a hot wife and a couple of guitars hanging on the wall (like I do). Screw the fame. Simplicity, anonymity, and peaceful easy feeling is priceless. I’m sure he has those moments.</p>
<p>It’s fun to think about, and I enjoyed my brief time in the spotlight with (https://twitter.com/stephmarco/status/475511293395603456). Plus, I’ll always be able to pick up my guitar and sing John Mayer tunes to Lily.</p>
