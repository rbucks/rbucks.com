&lt;p&gt;It's been too long since I've posted here, but I've been writing on the Shovels blog, writing to my investors, and writing gobs and gobs of emails. I spend my evenings clearing my inbox or writing code. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight, however, is different. I feel like making my first rbucks post in a while. It's because I have something to share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll throw this up on LinkedIn eventually, but my good news humblebrag here is that Shovels broke $80,000/mo in revenue last week. That's $80K MRR in startup-speak. That's shorthand for a million dollars per year in revenue! (I know, the real number is $83,333, but we'll round that down.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a big deal. It's the thing every startup dreams of when they first launch: let's make a million dollars. Let's clear that bar. At $80,000 per month you have a real business and you can support some real employees. There's NO DOUBT that the business has legs. The only question now is how far you can take it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took us 20 months to get here, and I have to admit that for the first time in my entrepreneurial career, I never doubted that this would happen. I knew Shovels felt different. I felt different. Together, we felt different. It was the right idea at the right time &lt;em&gt;for me&lt;/em&gt;. This trilogy is important. However, if I had to pick one from the three that matters most, it'd be the idea. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that's what I want to share here: the importance of idea. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I interviewed to teach at DVC, I had to put a lesson plan together. I decided to do it on ideation. I still have my notes. I decided that tonight I need to turn this double-sided piece of paper into a blog post. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's an idea?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An idea is a thought or suggestion as to a suggested course of action or a concept / belief. That's what the dictionary says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Entrepreneurs call an idea &lt;strong&gt;a way to solve an unmet need.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unmet need! This concept is important. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's use an example: the light bulb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's a light bulb? Is it an idea? Or a solution? What's the purpose of a light bulb and whom does it benefit? A light bulb might solve several problems; which is the most important? Most of us have never thought of a light bulb like this. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientist says, "My idea is to create light from electricity."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entrepreneur says, "My idea is to make people more productive indoors and at night."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A "business idea" takes an "idea" a few steps further. Let's explain this using our ideation selection framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How do you choose an idea?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should evaluate an idea by considering each of these attributes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Criteria&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Evaluation&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Target market&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Size&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Existing solution&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Penetration&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Unmet need&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Urgency&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Key benefits&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Strength&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Defensibility&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Technology&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For each of the criteria, you want more of the evaluation. A good idea should be positive in every evaluation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An efficient way to evaluate is to turn the table above into a sentence. For our light bulb, it would go like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For anyone dissatisfied with candles and kerosene lamps due to dimness, flicker, and inconvenience, I'm creating a light bulb that is bright, constant, portable, and electric, and is also difficult to manufacture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one-liner also makes a great pitch! When you have a strong idea, your pitch is also strong. They always go together. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shovels made it to $80K MRR because it was a good idea. That's the bulk of it. It helped that I was motivated, that I had the perfect co-founder, and I was able to get a great team together. Those aren't small things, but none of it would have been impactful if the idea was bad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So while I celebrate this moment, and I've been glowing about it all week (enjoying it while it lasts), I'm simultaneously humbled by the simple fact that I'm at the mercy of the idea. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies work because ideas work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Entrepreneurs are merely vectors for good ideas.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category><category term="entrepreneurship"></category><category term="shovels"></category><category term="business-strategy"></category><category term="advice"></category><category term="startups"></category></entry><entry><title>Short post of appreciation</title><link href="https://rbucks.com/2025/02/17/short-post-of-appreciation/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2025-02-17T21:07:00-08:00</published><updated>2025-02-17T21:07:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Ryan Buckley</name></author><id>tag:rbucks.com,2025-02-17:/2025/02/17/short-post-of-appreciation/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'd like to think that I take nothing for granted, that I'm always present and appreciative and live life to the fullest.

None of this is true, of course. I get caught up in what I'm doing or the exact opposite, caught up on my screens, oblivious to what I or anyone around me is doing. Either way, I get sucked into the vortex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I can say with certainty is I have held myself to one standard: when my kid asks for my attention, I give it to them, and when they ask me to do something with them -- &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; with them -- I do it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today is a holiday, President's Day, so my kids were not in school, but my wife and I worked. After dinner I did what I usually do while my kids are noodling around the house: I worked. I think I was editing a Snowflake query when I heard those magical words, "Dad, will you play chess with me?" &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did the right thing. I closed my MacBook and walked to the kitchen table where I keep a chessboard for this exact reason. While I played chess with my 8-year-old, my 10-year-old was practicing "Let It Be" on the piano. She was playing on the Yamaha Clavinova that I bought to replace the Baldwin piano that I inherited from my grandpa. Chess and piano. These are not the pieces of the puzzle that my wife brought to the picture. These are both mine, two hobbies that my kids adopted and seem to really enjoy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the rest of their lives, they'll know how to play chess. They'll appreciate the game. And at least one of my kids will know how to find middle C and play an A minor chord on piano. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did that, and it took work. It took leading by example and showing interest when they showed interest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm thinking about this tonight because yesterday my wife learned that her good friend was going through something awful. Her husband is on life support, perhaps from a heart attack, but we don't know. He's been in a coma for a week. They have two kids and a third child is due in five months. He may not make it. It's a tragedy on every dimension. I can't think of anything positive about this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't help but think, "What if it was me?" What would I regret? What would my kids remember? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of us hope to die surrounded by family. I still read the obituaries and most of the time that's what they say. There must be a reason for it. Family is in our DNA, ever present in our thoughts, a safe place in our souls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our friend's husband might die surrounded by family. He may not know it. He also might break the coma and live another healthy fifty years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time will tell, but in the meantime, I take this moment to appreciate what I've done well and what I'll still improve. Take it day by day, try to be present, and appreciate everything I love.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category><category term="personal"></category><category term="reflection"></category><category term="appreciation"></category><category term="gratitude"></category><category term="lifestyle"></category></entry><entry><title>Thoughts on building a brand</title><link href="https://rbucks.com/2024/12/25/thoughts-on-building-a-brand/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-12-25T09:06:00-08:00</published><updated>2024-12-25T09:06:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Ryan Buckley</name></author><id>tag:rbucks.com,2024-12-25:/2024/12/25/thoughts-on-building-a-brand/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Marketing is increasingly central to who I am and what I do as an entrepreneur.

This is not what I expected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I started in entrepreneurship, I was the operations guy, not the CEO. I liked to think about how things worked. I dealt with the accountants, the lawyers, the recruiters. It was fun and I was good at it. When my first business failed, I remember meeting with a top-tier VC who funded us. He asked what I was going to do next. I said I didn't know. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Every company needs a Ryan Buckley," he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Thank you," I replied, unsure of exactly what he meant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conversation stuck with me ten years later. That was my personal brand back then: The guy who works behind the scenes and gets things done. A capable workhorse with some leadership potential. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My brand is different now: The CEO of Shovels who writes about entrepreneurship and building permit data. For my LinkedIn followers, I hope it's also about thoughtfulness and authenticity. For my new investors, I hope it's about determination and transparency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of all the definitions of what a brand is, I like Seth Godin's concept of a &lt;em&gt;promise&lt;/em&gt;. A brand a promise. It's a set of expectations tightly bundled together into this thing that we call a brand. The rbucks.com blog brand is some authentic content (not AI), well-written (I try to minimize typos), about topics that I find interesting. The Shovels brand is high quality construction data accompanied with helpful customer service. The Saranap brand (my neighborhood) is walkable, family-friendly, charming area with lots of young kids. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A brand promises that these expectations are met. If the promise is broken by unmet expectations, the brand loses value. It gets tarnished. The best brands in the world have accumulated greater and greater expectations over the years, and the years themselves produce compounding value. This is how brands become incredibly valuable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One important note: a brand is not a logo. A logo is not a brand. A logo can represent a brand, and a beautiful logo can enhance a brand on the margins, but the logo itself doesn't make the brand. Here are some examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;!({static}/images/American_Express_logo_2018.svg_-1024x1022.png)

!({static}/images/Gap_logo.svg_-1024x1024.png)

!({static}/images/Bass_logo.svg_-849x1024.png)
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American Express: Just a light blue square with the name of the company&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gap: Just a dark blue square with the name of the company&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bass: Just a red triangle above the name of the company&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, the fonts are distinctive, but that's the effect of decades (or in the Bass case, nearly 250 years) of presence in society. A logo can be very, very simple, and the brand can still represent a wide variety of complex associations and expectations. Brand development takes hard work, years of consistency, and a dedicated staff to ensure that expectations are always met. Logo development just takes a consultant. I care about brands far, far more than I care about logos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My final point ties brand to culture. It's hard to imagine a great brand without a great culture, because you need that culture for the brand to consistently meet expectations. Years of achieving excellence cannot be driven by an outside consultant, a beautiful logo, or the perfect website with optimized copy. It's culture. Culture makes the brand work and that's why it's so important. Culture makes the product great, the support friendly, the documentation current. It's all of the things that allow a company to fulfill and even exceed the promise that the brand represents. I truly believe this. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've had to think a lot recently about the Shovels brand. What does it mean to our audience? Is it meeting and exceeding expectations? Are the logo and website good brand ambassadors? It's been brought up to me more than once that we should consider a rebrand, make the Shovels guy and logo a bit more polished and serious. We should hire consultants to "rebrand" us. On the one hand, I can see that: make the logo more serious, get more serious customers! But on the other hand, it didn't sit right with me. Logos don't make companies. Logos don't make brands. Logos don't delight customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I squashed it. We need design help, but we don't need a rebrand. And to the extent we need to rethink our positioning, that's work we have to do in-house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not a great slide designer, so I hired someone who can make great slides. They're not trying rebrand us. They're taking our content, our logo, and working with our brand to make a sales deck that looks nice. I'll translate the design over to the website and make it look nicer. These are useful exercises that are &lt;em&gt;part&lt;/em&gt; of building our brand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll always keep rethinking what we do and how we describe it. But WE need to be the ones doing it because that's how WE entrench the culture that makes our brand work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe there's such thing as a "good enough" logo. The three logos above fit that mold. They're not beautiful. They're just logos, and they're good enough. What makes the three &lt;em&gt;brands&lt;/em&gt; stand the test of time is everything else. That's what I'm focused on.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category><category term="entrepreneurship"></category><category term="branding"></category><category term="marketing"></category><category term="business-strategy"></category><category term="reflection"></category></entry><entry><title>A short essay on free will</title><link href="https://rbucks.com/2024/06/11/a-short-essay-on-free-will/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-06-11T19:20:00-07:00</published><updated>2024-06-11T19:20:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Ryan Buckley</name></author><id>tag:rbucks.com,2024-06-11:/2024/06/11/a-short-essay-on-free-will/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;My most pretentious title yet! 🥳&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever. I’m not a philosopher, but neither are my friends. So here goes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe in free will. Put me in the camp that says my choices today were not dictated by the cosmic explosion 14.3 billion years ago. I believe there is randomness in the world. I believe in chance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, I believe this truth to be self-evident. I’ll try to briefly explain using a short proof that the free will argument is flawed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The logic goes like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we don’t have free will, then chance does not exist&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If chance does not exist, then everything can be predicted&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If everything can be predicted, then time does not exist&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If time does not exist, then we don’t exist (consciousness, space, everything falls apart)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we do exist (just ask Descartes), then we must have free will&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To fully give these ideas the inside-out analysis they need is beyond my ability. I don’t have the time to get caught up on all the philosophy already written on these concepts. I won’t enjoy writing about it, either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I’m sharing here is a thought that I can’t shake. It’s my best attempt at explaining why it’s completely abhorrent to me that we should throw our hands up and believe we have no choice. That world sounds so dull. I don't want to live in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To not have free will implies the existence of a plan, a god-like creator who set the dominos tumbling. I don’t like this at all. It’s too religious, so I reject it on those grounds too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless, I will briefly explain the five parts of my counterfactual argument. I'm going to argue against the existence of free will in order to prove that it does in fact exist. I'm trying to prove that free will leads to a conclusion that we all must agree could not be possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;If we don't have free will, then chance does not exist&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeesh, what a place to start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I don’t think too hard about this one, it appears quite simple. With no free will, everything is pre-ordained. Let's be clear here: &lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt; are not special. We are made out of the same star dust as tectonic plates and asteroids. If we don't have free will, then nothing has free will. We have to apply the same rules to the entirety of the universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus everything happens for a reason, and that reason is built into the very fabric of our universe. Every law of physics, biology, and chemistry is describing the perfect order that was set from the beginning of time. If you wound back the clock and replayed the big bang, every single little thing, from the flicker of a butterfly's wing to the last presidential election, every war, murder, crash of a wave, earthquake and cosmic explosion would happen in exactly the same way at exactly the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's what no free will means. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, if there is no free will, then chance cannot exist, because all the cards were dealt 14.3 billion years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;If chance does not exist, then everything can be predicted.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s important to note that this argument doesn’t need to explain &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; everything is predicted. The point is the mere &lt;em&gt;possibility&lt;/em&gt; of perfect omnipotent prediction. Without chance, we leave open the possibility that every single little and large event can be predicted. I find that the anti-free will argument requires this to be true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, this argument flows logically from the last one. If everything is preordained, if the cards are dealt and the game proceeds by fixed rules, then if you know all the cards, you can predict everything. I'm not shaken by the idea that nobody can know all the cards. That fact doesn't matter. What matters is that if the cards are known then the future, the entire future can be predicted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this argument flows logically from the last one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;If everything can be predicted, then time does not exist&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we start to get into the heart of what I'm trying to say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the game of Hearts, this is where you see me slough a diamond instead of a heart or the queen of spades. You get suspicious of what I'm up to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, this here is the crux of my argument. Everything hinges on this point. If you want to attack my line of reasoning, this is where you should start. I'll try to support my position knowing I've left my kidney exposed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a universe where the future is perfectly predictable, we have no need for time. Given this as fact, time makes no sense. Therefore, it must not exist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll briefly explain. If I have the cards, I can play out the future. As I perfectly predict the future, time compresses. I bring the future forward and time loses meaning. It's only when the world is unpredictable that time is necessary. You need time for chance to be chance, for unpredictability to exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can predict everything, you don't need time. Therefore, time isn't required. If time isn't required, then it won't exist. If it won't exist, then it does not exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1585341984679469056).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;If time does not exist, then we don’t exist&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It follows. If we have no need for time, then we have no need for anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time builds our reality. Without it, there's nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if we have no chance, we have no time, and we have... nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll just end that line of reasoning there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Since we do exist, then we must have free will&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's my other vulnerable point. I'm presupposing that we exist. I'm anchoring on Descartes, the one shoulder I stand on. I assume this to be truth, therefore the argument that we have no free will &lt;em&gt;must &lt;/em&gt;be false.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other way to turn this around is to say that those who are anti-free will are also anti-consciousness and anti-Descartes. They must believe that we are living in a grand simulation, connected to the matrix, that we all took the blue pill and are in a dream world controlled by intelligent machines. The AI overlords have already taken over and we're all just pawns on their grand chess board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I reject this wholeheartedly. I just can't believe it. It's fatalistic. That is wrong and I think I've proven it. &lt;/p&gt;

Maybe the biggest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I shared a couple of blog posts ago, (https://rbucks.com/2023/08/25/happy-41st-birthday-to-me/). Age is only a number, but it has become a symbol on a map. It's the sign post on the road, a ticking clock. Turning 41 in 2023 meant a lot to me. It meant roots, friendships, patterns, and routines. It meant kids that are getting older and more independent. It meant a marriage that lasted many times longer than the one between my mom and dad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted financial stability when my kids were young and we had a (https://rbucks.com/2016/03/22/an-ode-to-the-suburbs/) and then (https://rbucks.com/2021/11/14/how-we-did-our-home-addition-and-remodel/). Now it's different. I feel like I can dream big again. This past year set the stage. This next year is when I go for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Shovels to find product-market fit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, this is going to be the year of (https://rbucks.com/2022/11/22/business-evaluation-shovels/). I've already gone all-in on this idea. I've raised $1.3M to date, and likely will raise another $200K more before hitting the upper limit on how much dilution we can take in this round. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the fundraising is important because we need it, the goal is to build a big business. Big to me, right now, is $10M ARR (annual recurring revenue). That's the target, and I'm willing to fight tooth and nail to get there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The path that we'll take is selling to the enterprise. We have to sell bigger deals to bigger companies. The ability for me to hire a sales team depends on it. We'll still take the smaller customers -- I want to support climate tech startups -- but we can't spend time handholding them through the process. The product itself will need to do 99% of it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have 10 small customers. Our MRR (monthly recurring revenue) is already higher than my last two bootstrapped companies. This business is inherently different. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big deals are in my pipeline, and I'm attracting an elite team to help me find more. It's all very clear to me. It just makes sense. It's like I can see the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I think about Shovels, I feel a combination of pride, excitement, and anticipation. It's a potent mixture. I think the last time I had it was in college. Everything worked out as planned (I went to grad school at Harvard) and I have many reasons to believe that my dreams for Shovels will come true too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll know if it's working by the start of summer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Teaching to be rewarding&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I'm not doing business, I'm teaching it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This spring I'll teach a couple of supervision and management courses that I've never taught before. I'm looking forward to it. I did most of my course preparation last week in Hawaii. Poolside, palm trees swaying in the breeze, the Pacific Ocean in the distance. Kids playing in the pool. It could be worse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to introduce cases into my teaching. Every week, we'll discuss a case and I'll let the students work on their responses in class. The supervision and management cases are interesting. We'll discuss Uber and Netflix, how cultures form, and how important leadership is throughout the lifecycle of a business. As Shovels grows up, examples like these will take on new meaning. It's the perfect time for me to study management, supervision, and leadership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm living these lessons as I teach them, and for me this has become something of a superpower. I really enjoy interacting with students in class. I like extemporaneous speech. I look forward to grading. Perhaps someday it will get tiring. Maybe I'll find that I can no longer be an entrepreneur while I teach entrepreneurship. I'm not so sure, though. For now, I'm finding that doing and teaching at the same time has a positive amplifying effect on both. If that ever changes, I'll deal with it then. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Friendships to matter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks before I turned 40, I took a group of guys up to (https://rbucks.com/2019/03/03/my-happy-place/). We hiked, we swam, we grilled, and we played Cards Against Humanity. It was awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember vividly one moment at the end of the weekend. Only two guys remained, and since I was their ride home, they helped me put the cabin back together. We were sweeping the front deck when my career came up, and I lamented that I wasn't sure exactly what I was going to do next. I had some ideas but I was uncertain which one to pick. I told them I really wanted to be a climate tech CEO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"That makes all the sense in the world," one of my friends said. The other agreed emphatically. On the drive home, I decided my building permit idea was the best one and hired a couple of programmers on Upwork to start scraping permits in Contra Costa County the following day. This was the start of the chain reaction that would become Shovels. It happened because of my friends. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm making more friends as a result of the work I'm doing on Shovels and at DVC. I'm also hearing from more old friends than any time in recent memory. I find it very rewarding, and it tells me that I'm doing something right. My network grows when I'm most productive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fitness to keep improving&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm in the best shape of my life. It's true. I credit a combination of my daily core routine, training for some (https://rbucks.com/2023/04/08/an-exploration-of-deep-exhaustion/), and doing a triathlon which really was about forcing myself to swim laps. Now a typical workout week for me looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5 mornings of 10 minute core. Mondays I do a 5 minute straight arm blank. Tuesday through Friday I do 4 minutes on my elbows. The rest of the workout is various crunches, stretches, squats, and 40 pushups. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of 5.5 mile runs. Plus one 10+ mile run or a 35 mile bike ride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 mile swim at a pace of about 2 mins per 100 yards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Peloton workout. My favorite is a 20 minute ride followed by a 20 minute full body strength&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The morning core routine, which I've now been doing for more years than I can track, is table stakes. It's always there, so I don't think about it. This means I work out twice on most days. It feels normal. In fact, on days when I don't work out at all, I get restless. That's when I head out to the backyard cottage where we have our Peloton stuff and knock one out. I have to exercise every day or I don't feel right. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was younger, I remember thinking one sweaty exercise a week was all I needed. Maybe that was true at the time. A few years ago, I got into a rhythm of exercising every third day. One day on, two days off. It felt like work, but I stuck to it. I've been narrowing that gap in off days ever since, and it's now to the point where even on vacation I have to get my workouts in. The only days I didn't exercise in Hawaii were the days spent packing and flying. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm proud of (https://www.strava.com/athletes/6960326). I want to keep it going. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;To take chess more seriously&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chess is a different kind of release. It's what I do to ramp into work mode. It's also what I do to reward myself for getting work done. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I happen to be on a really good clip right now. My chess is strong, but I've been playing long enough to know that it's cyclical. This could last another two weeks or maybe another two months. Then I'll hit a losing streak and drop about 200 points. Right now, though, I see the board and accurately anticipate my opponents' moves. I know this because they slow down in response. It's thrilling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I play 5-0 and 3-0 games. That means five minutes, no increment, or three minutes, no increment. These are fast games. I like using the clock as a weapon. No incremental time after each move (alternatively, you can get 2 or 3 seconds back after each move).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A different personality comes out when I play chess. I talk shit (chat it, actually). I'm hyper-competitive. I allow myself to dislike my opponent. I'm mean!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I had to critique my entrepreneurship, it's that I tend to be too nice. It's great for building a network, but it's probably bad for sales and negotiation. I want to pull parts of my chess personality into my entrepreneur personality. That's one goal for this year, especially as each new Shovels enterprise deal becomes a negotiation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's five good goals for me to keep in mind going into this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm ready 😁&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category><category term="goals"></category><category term="shovels"></category><category term="teaching"></category><category term="fitness"></category><category term="reflection"></category></entry><entry><title>The importance of mentors</title><link href="https://rbucks.com/2023/11/05/the-importance-of-mentors/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-11-05T20:35:00-08:00</published><updated>2023-11-05T20:35:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Ryan Buckley</name></author><id>tag:rbucks.com,2023-11-05:/2023/11/05/the-importance-of-mentors/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;"Are you mentoring anybody?" my old mentor asked me a few weeks ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"No, I'm not." And I stopped to think about that for a minute. I don't have a mentor right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lisa Bauer is my old mentor. I worked for her in college, but it felt like she …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;"Are you mentoring anybody?" my old mentor asked me a few weeks ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"No, I'm not." And I stopped to think about that for a minute. I don't have a mentor right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lisa Bauer is my old mentor. I worked for her in college, but it felt like she was also my partner. She guided me through the politics of UC Berkeley, helping me understand the incentive structures that make the university tick. Our interests were aligned: I was a capable and hungry 18-year-old interested in environmental policy, and she was an ambitious and underfunded 40-year-old running the campus recycling and refuse program. She needed help. I needed a project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn't know this then, but I also needed a mentor, and she was the perfect fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through Lisa and the other students she cultivated, I joined a cadre of great organizers. They knew how to execute an idea and keep it running. They were smart in the right ways, and I discovered I also had a natural talent for navigating the campus bureaucracy. The truth is, I liked it, and the people I met on campus seemed to like me. It was easy, and it didn't feel like work. When I ran into problems, Lisa helped. I remember feeling back then that I made her proud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We stayed in touch off and on after I graduated, reconnecting over a meal at her house in Berkeley every few years. It was easy to stay friends despite the long gaps in communication. When she sent a group email recently about wanting to find a renter for her house in Berkeley, I replied and suggested we meet again. After some back and forth, I offered to visit her ranch way out in the Anderson Valley. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It had been years, but we hit off like old times. We chatted while Lisa and her husband, Doug, cooked dinner. It occurred to me that I'm at the age now that Lisa must have been when we worked together 20 years ago. I told her that even in retrospect, with the decades washing away the loose memories, I still consider the projects we worked on the most important part of my Berkeley experience. That type of work, the organizing, politicking, networking, planning, strategizing... that's what I love to do. Doing this under her tutelage was a masterclass. It definitely helped me get into the Harvard Kennedy School, and MIT Sloan, and there's a straight line between all of that and meeting my wife, becoming an entrepreneur, and building the life I'm living today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mentor relationship is unique. It's personal and professional. These days that's a sensitive topic, but I liked that Lisa often treated me and her other student employees like peers. She said what was on her mind. She gave us relationship advice. The work was serious and important, but when we worked, it was casual and often funny. Most importantly, we knew that she cared both about the mission of making our little piece of the planet more sustainable and about nurturing and helping us.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't have that now. I have friends, connections, formal and informal advisors, but I don't have an older, wiser coach in my corner checking in and making sure I'm doing my best work. I don't have someone opening doors for me, feeding me ideas and opportunities. I no longer have an advocate and I want to get that back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having a mentor seems to be effective. I keep running into these relationships in the biographies of successful people. Here are a few that I remember:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arnold Schwarzenegger had Joe Weider to help him navigate the American bodybuilding circuit and get his first acting role&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Beckham had Sir Alex Ferguson as his coach and surrogate father for many years while he played for Manchester United&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Albert Einstein had Max Talmud, who introduced him to math, science, and philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it ever too late to get a mentor? I hope not. When I think across all of my professional relationships, I have the individual pieces that make up a mentor. I have a lot of people supporting me through my current projects. I have to work to solicit the output and cull the ideas. I don't have it all in one person the way I did with Lisa so many years ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I miss that.&lt;/p&gt;

I checked to see how many episodes there were and how long each one was, as I always do when somebody recommends a new series to me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten episodes! Each one 45 minutes! I hesitated at the commitment but took the plunge. Fortunately, I was not disappointed. The acting: phenomenal. I thought I was witnessing the actual Albert as a young man struggling with his place in the universe. I enjoyed seeing old Albert as a dirty old man, fondling his secretary. And in between, we get to know the wire-haired caricature Eintein, sometime in his 40s and 50s, as an unconventional physicist, unafraid to yield to his libertarian tendencies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this was brilliant because it presented Albert Einstein as a complex, flawed, deeply insecure human being. His brilliance and creativity as a physicist were also on display, but his success was merely a backdrop to his personal life, which was not brilliant at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tragedy around most, but not all, of his personal relationships was not due to social awkwardness. On the contrary, Albert was outspoken, charming, and funny. He had much to say and, famously, much to ask. Curious people are fun to be around, and Albert had many friends. He had a typical relationship with his own family, his parents and his sister. He struggled with an unapproving dad, but that's not unusual.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We witness his curiosity getting him into trouble in school, ultimately leading to expulsion. He had to find his own way into college, forcing his way to the Polytechnic Institute in Zurich, where he excelled at math and physics but had no patience for other subjects. We begin to see the iconoclast emerge in the classroom. His ability to break with conformity was a pattern throughout his life. I admire and respect him for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also chose not to conform as a typical husband and father when he got his girlfriend pregnant. The series presents this relationship as an honest, true love. I remember a scene when Albert tells Mileva, "I am madly in love with your mind." They agree to marry, but the relationship turns tragically toxic. They have two boys together, and Albert is an inconsistent father. Mileva, his intellectual equal at the Polytechnic Institute, gave up her career to raise their family and support Albert's research while he worked at the patent office. It's unclear how much she contributed, but there are several scenes where Albert professes his indebtedness to her hard work and insights. Nonetheless, he never formally credited her on his papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was a doting father when he was with the boys, but when he needed to work, he focused only on his work. As his relationship with Mileva soured, he spent less time at home, and the boys suffered. Albert recognized the impact of his decisions but shrugged it off as the sad byproduct of a bad marriage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was also a philanderer. He met Mileva while in a serious relationship with another woman. He couldn't bring himself to tell her and kept his long-distance relationship alive while courting Mileva. Similarly, he fell in love with Elsa, a distant cousin, while his marriage to Mileva dissolved. And while he was with Elsa, he had numerous affairs: a secretary, an artist's wife who was a Russian spy... those are two I remember. Albert was either a man of the times (apparently, wives expected this behavior) or felt compelled to display his iconoclastic stripes in all parts of his life. The show didn't editorialize Albert's conscience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this happens against the backdrop of the rise of Hitler and the Third Reich. Albert is weary of Hitler's rise to power but refuses to believe that Germany will fall completely under the Nazi regime. He holds out, even as antisemites publicly disparage his research as "Jewish science." Eventually, he conceded that Nazism would overtake Germany, and he and Elsa moved to Princeton. The presentation of this tension is masterful. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The show ends with Einstein struggling to maintain the mental stamina he had as a young man. He needed to solve the unified field theory, which would unify much of his earlier research, but he was unsuccessful. He succumbed to age as any old man will. He was merely human, after all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I admire Albert Einstein for making huge bets on himself many times throughout his life. He willed his way to success, and he paid for it personally, but history has paid him back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could he have been a good dad and a great physicist? Without his foibles, would he maintain his brilliance? These are the questions I'm left asking. I want to believe it's possible.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category><category term="albert-einstein"></category><category term="profiles"></category><category term="philosophy"></category><category term="reflection"></category><category term="life-lessons"></category></entry><entry><title>An exploration of deep exhaustion</title><link href="https://rbucks.com/2023/04/08/an-exploration-of-deep-exhaustion/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-04-08T20:59:00-07:00</published><updated>2023-04-08T20:59:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Ryan Buckley</name></author><id>tag:rbucks.com,2023-04-08:/2023/04/08/an-exploration-of-deep-exhaustion/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This month I plan to push my endurance to the outer limits.

I rode my bicycle 142 miles in just under 12 hours a week ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A week from now, I will do it again, but with twice the vertical climb. It will be my second year in a row doing the (https://www.belgianwaffleride.bike/pages/california), a day-long ride on road, gravel, and sandy dirt trails in the hills above San Marcos, California. It's a silly 135 miles and 11,000 feet of climb. That's the equivalent of riding around the base of Mt. Diablo twice and hitting the summit three times. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who does a ride like that? Me, apparently. It's becoming clearer to me why I like doing it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term "deep exhaustion" comes to mind when I think about why I do this. I googled it. Deep exhaustion has mostly negative connotations, like when you hit a wall of fatigue and can't break through it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's not the deep exhaustion I'm referring to. This type of exhaustion sits in your bones but drives you forward. You somersault through the fatigue and come around to the other side of it. You find energy in the heavy cloak. Somehow, incomprehensibly, the deep exhaustion actually feels good. It's comforting because it's supposed to be there, and the thrill lies in seeing how long and how far you can carry it with you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the start of my 142-mile loop, it took about 40 miles and a bit over two hours for me to ride from my house in Lafayette to the estuary on the eastern side of the Dumbarton Bridge. That's when I got my first taste of tiredness. I stopped there and stretched. I filled my water bottles at a little trailhead visitor center structure. I took this picture there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;!({static}/images/IMG_4207-1024x768.jpeg)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was still feeling good. I stretched my legs, felt a twinge of cramp coming on but shook it off. I hopped back on and kept going. At 50 miles, I took a picture at the peak of the bridge span. I took my last picture as I entered Martinez from the north ninety miles later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;!({static}/images/IMG_4208-1024x768.jpeg)

!({static}/images/IMG_4216-1024x768.jpeg)
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I planned to circle the bay and cross five of the seven bridges (I couldn't fit San Mateo in and the Bay Bridge has no bike lane on the western span.) From the Dumbarton Bridge, I headed north up the western shore, through San Mateo, Redwood City, Belmont, and into SFO. The stretch along the airport is a drain. It's long and windy. Eventually, I crossed the freeway and hit another windy stretch opposite Candlestick Point, near the Cow Palace. This is the threshold between South San Francisco and SF proper. The Bayview / Hunter's Point district is not my favorite part of the city. I push up and then down the hills and onto the Chase Center and Oracle Park. I followed the Embarcadero around to the Golden Gate Bridge. This is about 85 miles from home. I cross into Sausalito, and a quick twenty miles later, I'm on the Richmond Bridge span. This is my third bridge with a wide, protected bicycle lane. I got a little lost (Garmin fail) between the Richmond Bridge and the Carquinez Bridge (the fourth), but I finally found it about 125 miles into the ride. Fifteen miles later, I hit the fifth bridge. Mission accomplished! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deep exhaustion hit me right around mile 60. I carried it for another 80 miles. I'm proud that I lasted that long. It took work and preparation to do this. I trained by exercising regularly. I run, I swim, and I bike. I generally do one of them every other day. So my base fitness was good going into this monster ride. I stopped, stretched, and ate every 20 miles. I mentally rode in 5-mile increments, each one a step closer to my next break. At the sixty-mile mark, I was somewhere in Belmont and stopped at a Roam burger restaurant. I ate like a champion. Feeling better but still quite tired, I kept going. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twenty miles later, I was on the Embarcadero, tourists everywhere. I pulled to the side and forced a few handfuls of trail mix down my throat. I was tired, but I wasn't any more tired than I was at mile 60. That awareness gave me strength. I crossed the century mark in Larkspur. Again I wasn't any more tired than before, and I was excited to head back to the east bay. More energy. At mile 120, I was just north of Rodeo. I stopped on a bikeway right along the bayfront. I could feel my energy waning with the afternoon. I was about ten hours into the ride at this point, and I was concerned I wouldn't make it home before dark. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mile 140 was a short stop in Benicia. I fed myself, but I wasn't feeling great. The deep exhaustion was starting to wear me out. I crossed the Martinez Bridge and was already in the evening shadows. The sun was still up, but the hills to the west hid it. The temperature never broke 60F the whole ride, but I felt cold for the first time here. I rode a quiet street through a refinery to get to the main road connecting Martinez and Concord. I was uncomfortable, jittery, and hungry, but I couldn't eat any more of the food in my little backpack. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I peddled forward, finally reaching the commercial stretch of Pleasant Hill. I saw a McDonald's and decided to stop. I ordered my food and sat haggardly, my helmet and gloves still on. I filled a cup with Dr. Pepper and ate my Big Mac. The evening turned to dusk, and I wasn't going to leave that McDonald's on my bike. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took the last seven miles home in an Uber. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I survived. No close calls, no near collisions. I didn't let foolish pride get in my way of a safe ride home. At that point, I was in no condition to ride in the dark. I was able to push my limits without breaking them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that's what deep exhaustion is to me. It's the point where I push my endurance outward. I'm not a weightlifter, but I understand that muscle gets built on slow, consistent reps with heavier and heavier weights. Perhaps endurance works the same way. You grind your way to the outer limits, and you carry its heavy load in order to extend your stamina runway. Parts of the process are painful, but for the most part, it's fine. It's just a steady exertion for a long period of time. At some point, you can't go any further, but until then, you're just tired. Being tired, in the right context, can feel really good. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm looking forward to the Belgian Waffle Ride next weekend. I know it will be hard. I know I'll bump up against the limits of my exhaustion. I'll do a better job with nutrition and fluids. I'll stop at every checkpoint, relax my body, eat, drink, and stretch. I'll take as much time as I need and try to enjoy the process for what it is: an exploration of deep exhaustion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And boy oh boy, I'll look forward to eating dinner afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category><category term="cycling"></category><category term="endurance-sports"></category><category term="fitness"></category><category term="reflection"></category><category term="personal"></category></entry><entry><title>Knocking your NOx off</title><link href="https://rbucks.com/2023/03/18/knocking-your-nox-off/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-03-18T12:35:00-07:00</published><updated>2023-03-18T12:35:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Ryan Buckley</name></author><id>tag:rbucks.com,2023-03-18:/2023/03/18/knocking-your-nox-off/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I just started learning about nitrous oxide (NOx).

When we (https://rbucks.com/2021/08/26/the-importance-of-electrification/), we did it to burn less carbon. I signed up for (https://www.walnut-creek.org/departments/e-c-o/energy-innovation/mce-renewable-energy) so our share of energy usage would come from renewable sources. I felt good about paying extra (the notorious "green premium") for our all-electric home appliances. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel even better now. Nitrous oxide pollution has long been recognized as a significant contributor to air pollution and climate change, posing a threat to both human health and the environment. To address this pressing issue, the Board of Directors of the Air District held a public hearing on March 15, 2023, to consider the adoption of proposed amendments to Regulation 9, which addresses inorganic gaseous pollutants. These proposed amendments include the introduction of zero NOx standards for space and water heating appliances and an ultra-low NOx standard for furnaces, which would have a profound impact on reducing NOx emissions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amendments (https://www.baaqmd.gov/rules-and-compliance/rule-development/building-appliances)!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Need for Stronger NOx Standards&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NOx emissions are produced by various sources, including transportation, industrial processes, and building appliances, such as natural gas-fired boilers, water heaters, and fan-type residential central furnaces. NOx pollution contributes to the formation of ground-level ozone, smog, and fine particulate matter, which are associated with respiratory and cardiovascular health issues, particularly in vulnerable populations such as children, the elderly, and people with pre-existing health conditions. Additionally, NOx emissions have been linked to adverse environmental impacts, including acid rain, eutrophication of water bodies, and the depletion of stratospheric ozone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amendments to Rules 9-4 and 9-6 are a vital step in mitigating these harmful effects. By implementing a zero NOx standard for both space and water heating appliances and an ultra-low NOx standard for furnaces, the amendments will significantly reduce NOx emissions from residential and commercial buildings. These new standards are set to be enforced from 2027 to 2031, depending on the appliance, providing a clear timeline for manufacturers and consumers to transition to cleaner and more efficient technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Addressing Concerns&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the Draft Environmental Impact Report (EIR) for the proposed amendments concluded that there would be potentially significant and unavoidable impacts associated with utilities, services systems, and noise, it is important to put these concerns into perspective. The increased energy demand resulting from the replacement of existing natural gas-fired appliances with electric ones can be mitigated by continued investments in renewable energy sources and improvements in grid infrastructure. Moreover, the benefits of reducing NOx emissions, such as improved air quality and reduced greenhouse gas emissions, far outweigh the potential challenges associated with increased energy demand. Furthermore, I believe the market will solve grid demand issues and supply will ramp up over time to bring prices down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the noise impacts associated with certain zero NOx equipment can be addressed through technological advancements and proper installation techniques. In many cases, the noise levels of these appliances can be reduced to acceptable levels, ensuring that they do not pose a significant nuisance to residents. My heat pump water heater is louder than my old gas one, but we put it in the garage and don't hear it. Plus, the cold air it blows as exhaust is amazing in the summer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm glad the BAAQMD passed the amendments to Regulation 9. By adopting these stricter NOx standards, we can significantly reduce air pollution, protect public health, and mitigate the impacts of climate change.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category><category term="environment"></category><category term="climate-tech"></category><category term="sustainability"></category><category term="health"></category><category term="policy"></category></entry><entry><title>Taking advantage of the Inflation Reduction Act in Contra Costa County</title><link href="https://rbucks.com/2023/01/03/taking-advantage-of-the-inflation-reduction-act-in-contra-costa-county/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-01-03T12:00:00-08:00</published><updated>2023-01-03T12:00:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Ryan Buckley</name></author><id>tag:rbucks.com,2023-01-03:/2023/01/03/taking-advantage-of-the-inflation-reduction-act-in-contra-costa-county/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;After the success of (https://www.dvti.org/conference) conference, for which I chaired and did the bulk of the organizing, I was approached by a friend in the local sustainability community.

She asked me if I'd like to help organize a conference focusing on green tech in Contra Costa County. I enthusiastically said yes!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a lot to chew on around this topic. To summarize the three massive spending bills passed by the Biden administration in 2021 and 2022:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$550 billion in new spending over the next five years in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$280 billion in the CHIPS and Science Act&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$390 billion for clean energy in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This all amounts to "industrial policy," long considered the third rail in national politics for market meddling. But here we are, post-pandemic, with billions of money itching to be spent on green infrastructure. It's precisely the boon my fellow climate tech entrepreneurs have been waiting for. I want Contra Costa County, the (https://rbucks.com/2018/07/03/what-is-the-contra-costa-county-board-of-supervisors/) where I live, to take advantage of this. I want a green economy to grow and flourish in Contra Costa County. The question is: How do we take advantage of this windfall? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The funds for climate come from the IRA and the IIJA. We'll start with the IIJA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IIJA includes $21.5 billion for clean energy demonstrations and research hubs. There's $8 billion set aside for clean hydrogen. $2.5 billion for advanced nuclear, and $10 billion for carbon capture, direct air capture, and industrial emission reduction. The $1 billion allocated to demonstration projects in rural areas probably won't slide here, even though much of Contra Costa remains in its 19th-century state. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the real industrial oomph comes from the IIJA. The IRA, which gets most of the attention in the media, provides nearly $400 billion in tax credits for consumers and businesses to adopt clean technology. McKinsey summarized these credits as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$4,000 consumer tax credit for the purchase of a used electric vehicle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$2,000 consumer tax credit for the purchase of heat pumps, heat pump water heaters, biomass stoves, and boilers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$3 per kilogram for the production of clean hydrogen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$15 per megawatt-hour for power produced at a qualifying nuclear facility&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would love to see a renewed manufacturing sector in Contra Costa County. We're perfect for it. I'd argue we're better equipped than Fremont with its Tesla factory. We're closer to rail, the Central Valle,  Highway 5, and shipping ports, and we have "cheaper" housing. Our network of community colleges is perfect for supplying the labor for the advanced, high-skilled manufacturing industries to support the green economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to attract these businesses. But how? Contra Costa County has refineries but not much appliance manufacturing. We have a strong services sector, especially in the financial, medical, and real estate industries. We also have highly-trained tradespeople for building construction and maintenance. Diablo Valley College and our other local community colleges provide much of that training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, where does Contra Costa stand to benefit from the IIJA and IRA funds? I would look here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Services industries:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EV charger installation and maintenance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Heat pump installation and maintenance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EV and heat pump permitting, inspection, and construction management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Financial advice to access EV and heat pump incentives&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Real estate management to execute these retrofits and promote green buildings to tenants and buyers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Government sector:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Streamline EV charger permits&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Streamline water heater and HVAC permits&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Electrify government buildings and fleets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manufacturing industries:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EV chargers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Heat pumps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Solar panels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A stretch goal is to create a green technology manufacturing sector. For this to happen, we will need to get services going first and use that advantage to attract the industry. There's a lot of research to do here, starting with understanding if these appliances are built &lt;em&gt;anywhere&lt;/em&gt; in California. I suspect not. Suppose there's an economic rationale or the possibility of an incentive provided by these federal dollars directly or through the state. In that case, I hope our county leadership will be aware and make noise about getting our share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How big is our share? According to (https://www.gov.ca.gov/2022/11/15/california-creates-17000-infrastructure-jobs-with-support-from-the-biden-administration/) from the governor's office, California will receive more than $16 billion from the IIJA. Allocated by population, Contra Costa should receive about $400 million. Then there's the $47 billion multiyear infrastructure package already in the state budget. Our share of that budget is over $1 billion. So we have $1.4 billion potentially to work with, and more &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; we can be creative and put good proposals together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The media calls this a once-in-a-generation event. Unlike the similarly-described extreme weather we've been experiencing, I agree that this funding won't come again next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the case for organizing a Green Economy Conference in Contra Costa County. We need our representatives to see this window of opportunity, a critical period when economic incentives strongly align with environmental needs. A boom in green economic output could transform this county, producing the change I've been working towards through the (https://www.dvti.org).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can continue to leverage my connection to Diablo Valley College, which will play a key role in connecting workforce development initiatives to the green economy. I'll also bring in the connections and perspective I've gained recently from my work on (https://rbucks.com/2022/11/22/business-evaluation-shovels/).

I guess I'll start from where I left off on that (https://rbucks.com/2022/02/20/how-i-wrote-my-childrens-book/) about a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming into 2022, I was doing really great. (https://mightysignal.com/blog/airnow-acquires-mightysignal) and was enjoying the process of moving into our (https://rbucks.com/2021/11/14/how-we-did-our-home-addition-and-remodel/). I'd spend my evenings in the cottage (which wasn't described at all in that long blog post -- an accidental oversight) working on a (https://rbucks.com/2022/01/16/my-foray-into-web3/) and listening to loud music (thank you, (https://www.sonos.com/en-us/products/wireless-home-theater).) I was really happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I (https://rbucks.com/2022/02/10/my-first-month-of-real-teaching/) and my routine completely changed. As soon as I finished prepping for one class, another one was around the corner. Spring semester this year I taught thirteen units in five sections across four classes. Two of the sections were 90-minute lectures, back-to-back. It was a lot!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;!({static}/images/image-1024x773.png)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I figured since I was working from home that I could fit this all in: my startup obligations, family life, exercise, creativity, and yes, teaching. A whole shit-ton of teaching. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was wrong, of course. What suffered was my creativity. I never missed a work call, rarely missed my share of walking my kids to the bus or taking them to practice, and even managed to do a lot of cross training so I wouldn't wreck myself on the (https://belgianwaffleride.bike/pages/california). I got into the best shape of my life, actually, and would knock out 13 miles trail running, or 2,000 yards of swimming, or 50+ miles with some major climbs on my road bike, on a whim. I could wake up feeling like doing several hard hours of exercise and totally crush it. I found a way to make that all work. But I stopped writing for fun. I didn't have anything left in the tank for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, my first year under Airnow was rapidly approaching. I figured I would stay a while because I really liked my team and I wanted to take MightySignal "all the way" -- basically to see it become something of a big deal in the mobile data industry. Airnow, it seemed, would get us there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as the post-COVID boom collapsed, inflation soared, and the war in Ukraine reigned in global economic optimism, a new reality set in. There would be no huge victory party for us in 2022. MightySignal was still in a stagnant growth pattern and it wasn't clear to me how the rest of Airnow's business units were doing. The last few months have been hard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, in the midst of all my teaching, I started to think about what I would do next. It was an aggravating experience. I sent a few feeler emails out and got some responses, eventually leading to a couple of offers. One in particular was fantastic: an opportunity to lead another B2B SaaS company, build on my resume as a hired CEO, and take its $4 million revenue and $1 million net income startup into double digit millions. I could work from home, get good equity, and increase my salary by 40 percent. It was a virtual phone service company, a solid business with room to grow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only problem was I didn't want it. It took me a month to figure that out. When I turned it down, they offered me more money, and I turned it down again. "What kind of asshole turns down a job like this?" I texted a friend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I was relieved. It felt good to make a decision symbolic of what I really truly want to do next: work in climate tech. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's time. It's time for me to take another big risk. It's time for me to work on something that I actually care about. It's time for me to combine my extracurricular interests with my day job. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn't always see it this way. The turbulence en route stemmed from the recognition that a job doesn't &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to mean everything. I don't &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to love mobile data to work in it. If I'm passionate for something else, I can do it in my free time, which I'll probably get more and more of as my kids get older and older. So why not take a job that checks every other box and just let my job be my... job? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I suppose, the answer is it's just not that simple. Not for me, at least. I won't do my best work unless I can get truly excited about it, and I know I've been diluting my focus these last few years because I don't really care about the companies I've been running. The companies are functional means-to-ends, unfortunate necessities to allow me to volunteer and teach and do other community stuff that makes me happy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But all along I've had the nagging question: &lt;em&gt;why can't my day job also do thi&lt;/em&gt;s?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I'm going to find out. I've been telling people around me, including the guy who owns that virtual phone service company, that I'm doing climate tech next. It feels great! And along the way I've been networking with new people and re-networking with old contacts and beginning to sense where in the space I'm going to land. I've settled on two approaches: the well-funded startup and the unfunded idea, both in the residential retrofit space. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an incredible amount of work happening in climate tech. Here are just a few of the most interesting companies I've found:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(https://www.twelve.co/), which makes critical chemicals &lt;em&gt;from air&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(https://www.brimstone.energy/), which makes carbon negative Portland cement at market cost&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(https://www.blocpower.io/), which finances residential and commercial property decarbonization&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(https://www.carbios.com/en/), which uses enzymes to break down plastics&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(https://climeworks.com/), which absorbs CO2 from the air and stores it underground&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(https://www.wattcarbon.com/), which sources carbon offsets from buildings&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's all fascinating, incredible stuff. I would love to work at any of these companies and be on the frontlines of growing a business that is poised to make a lot of money while preventing humanitarian crises. I could see having boundless enthusiasm for this work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it's competitive, and being ten years out of the professional environmental game, I'm not anyone's top pick for a senior role. I've tried and failed to get some of these interviews. I'll keep trying, but I also have another way to get in. I can build a company myself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thinking seriously about a couple of ideas. One was around financing residential decarbonization using carbon offsets. I wanted to find a way to use the market value of the future unused CO2 to subsidize carbon-free renovations. It seemed like there should be a way to do this, but the pathway is far from clear. Nobody has figure it out yet, but (https://www.wattcarbon.com/) seems to be the closest. My revenue model would be an arbitrage between what the company pays to homeowners for their carbon credits and what the credits sell for in the market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My other idea was to quantify how green a home is. This would be a pure software play, or possibly with some hardware if partners don't cooperate. This company would ingest indoor temperature and air quality, thermostat and water heater usage, smart device usage, and any other home-related data streams we can access. Besides analyzing this data to give tips for living greener, it would be a database of households' "home stacks," or the specific appliances that they use. The revenue model would be freemium -- free to use with some paid upgrades on the consumer side and possibly some paid advertising on the business side. This is a variant of the (https://rbucks.com/2022/06/22/business-evaluation-clime/) I evaluated previously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The possibilities are endless, and I'm relieved to have finally settled on one idea, (https://rbucks.com/2022/11/22/business-evaluation-shovels/), which is not purely a climate business but one that fills a critical gap in the climate data puzzle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the way I describe what I do and why I chose to work on Shovels is that I found the intersection, after a lot of hard work, between B2B data and climate technology. Shovels is both and it's exciting and hard and... perfect for me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the coming years I will learn a lot about real estate and construction. I'll take another run at venture capital and running a high growth business that has to spend ahead of revenue. I can do it right this time and I'm very excited to use my scar tissue to my advantage. The current economic climate is also ideal for an entrepreneur with my background. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've known excess. I've known frugality. The ground in the middle is very fertile. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The leverage you get comes from the long handles. Keeping the load near the fulcrum allows you to lift the load off the ground with less effort. Since the purpose of a wheelbarrow is to move a load along a plane, not lift it up high, its design is perfect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I once needed to move a 450 pound boulder about 20 feet up a slight grade from the street to my front yard. I ended up watching a bunch of YouTube videos with grizzly-haired men talking about how ancient Egyptians built the pyramids. They relied on leverage and the efficiency of rolling and dragging rather than lifting and carrying. I got this boulder into my wheelbarrow, built a ramp to get it up the curb, and plopped that sucker onto its final resting place without herniating a disc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;!({static}/images/IMG_3856-1024x768.jpeg)
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have repaired this wheelbarrow many times. I've replaced and tightened many screws. I even had to buy a new wheel, a solid rubber variety that won't be susceptible to nails and rocks. It just keeps on giving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've lent it to my neighbors to move stumps and branches and piles of dirt around their properties. I've used this wheelbarrow to move stacks of pavers and bricks, cubic yards of dirt and decomposed granite, and even to transport gallons of water to a withering oak tree. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;My classroom&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm three weeks in with thirteen more to go until the end of the semester. I've learned a few things, but before I go into that, let me provide some context. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I described (https://rbucks.com/2019/10/17/why-im-applying-to-be-an-instructor-at-dvc/) in a previous post. I still believe all of it. My heart is 100% still in this. I love the community college atmosphere, the type of students I teach, and the subject itself. My first two semesters were, like so many educators, a shallow pit of Zoom office hours and online quizzes. It was fine but not particularly rewarding. I did all that work upfront and merely shepherded the course along as the weeks went by. I didn't feel like I was teaching. I was just the facilitator. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the Business Administration Department asked me to teach the only two in-person sections of Introduction to Business, a course that every business student needs to take, I eagerly accepted. This would be my moment! I could finally don my elbow-patched tweed blazer, smoke my pipe, and wax poetical before a chalkboard in front of enamored students. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, late last year, I chose my textbook and began to imagine how my lectures would go. My sections would be Tuesday and Thursday at 9:30am and 11am. Each is 80 minutes. I wanted to believe I could give an enchanting lecture every time, peppered with tails of my business experience, maybe incorporating something interesting and current from (https://mightysignal.com) and (https://www.airnow.com). Thinking back on my favorite lectures at UC Berkeley, I admired most the professors who could riff on current events and tie them back to the reading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been trying, desperately, to be that professor. I'm not sure I'm doing it right, but I do think I'm getting better. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, let's get back to what I've learned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Authenticity is rewarded&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I play Grateful Dead at the start of each class. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I always get to class early, and since I use my own laptop for some slides and other multimedia, I figured I should play music the way it's played at a concert venue before the opening act. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I chose Grateful Dead because it's calming (for me, at least) and unique. When I first started doing this a student in each of my sections called me out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Is that the Grateful Dead?" they asked. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Yup," I said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They nodded in quiet appreciation. I'd like to think they'll enjoy the class better now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also am quick to say when I'm not sure about an economic or business concept. It's not easy to riff on the news and relate it to the reading. Sometimes I talk myself into a corner, make a mental note and admit my confusion, and Google it as soon as I get home. I'm learning new things this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can actually feel myself getting a lot smarter. My own learning is driven by being curious, exploring the chapter concepts, and trying to teach it by drawing connections to current events. Sometimes it works better than others, but when I get it wrong, I recognize that's an opportunity for me to learn too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's good, and I believe my students reward me for it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Preparation is paramount&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't improvise a lecture. It would not be fun. I would stumble, feel awkward, and also feel bad for my students. I'd be failing them. I've found that weekends are great for reading the publisher's lecture notes, reviewing the publisher's slides, and imagining how I would want to present this information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I picture each lecture before I give it. I have the roadmap in mind and I leave myself little breadcrumbs so I stay on track. These might be penciled notes on paper or an agenda in PowerPoint. My challenge now is predicting how long it will take to go through a topic. I'm definitely getting better at that, but it's the biggest variable in my preparation. &lt;em&gt;How long will it take to talk about this?&lt;/em&gt; I have no idea. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I often find myself rushing at the end of the lecture. Maybe it's good that time seems to fly at the front of the lecture hall? I figure if I felt it going slow, my students would feel it even more so. Better that the 80 minutes goes quickly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My preparation thus far has been sufficient. I'm sure I could do more, but I'm glad I haven't done any less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Teaching live takes stamina&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teaching is a workout. I get the same high as an eight-mile run, but here it's all in my head. The feeling also reminds me of playing with the (https://rbucks.com/2019/10/17/becoming-a-better-public-singer/) after a really good show. I'd still be pumped up on adrenaline, glad that's over but happy with how the performance went. I get that buzz every Tuesday and Thursday after two back-to-back lectures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure what about it is so tiring. I do feel like I'm performing. I'm very deliberately shoving my introversions aside and my mind is running in overdrive, especially when I'm going off the cuff on one of my business news tangents. But like these workouts I've been doing recently, I've learned to love the exhaustion. I tell myself during my physical workouts that this is where muscle is born. It hurts because I'm giving birth to strength. Lecturing on a subject like microeconomics, international trade, or a new business framework is like that. I'm giving birth to knowledge. It's supposed to feel hard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also appreciate that it's getting easier. Like training to do a five minute straight-arm plank, what once felt impossible is now a daily routine. I'm just three weeks in. I don't know what it will feel like after sixteen, but I can't wait to find out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've always been told I'd make a good teacher. I've always agreed. I'm grateful to have the chance to explore this now. I'm glad that Diablo Valley College is a close drive (or, more commonly now, a bike ride) away. I'm glad I got a (https://rbucks.com/2019/06/06/what-my-grad-school-experience-meant-to-me/) -- without it, I would not have been hired. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This whole experience has been a major positive in my life and I expect it will only get better.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category><category term="teaching"></category><category term="education"></category><category term="career"></category><category term="personal"></category><category term="community-college"></category></entry><entry><title>My foray into web3</title><link href="https://rbucks.com/2022/01/16/my-foray-into-web3/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-01-16T18:45:00-08:00</published><updated>2022-01-16T18:45:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Ryan Buckley</name></author><id>tag:rbucks.com,2022-01-16:/2022/01/16/my-foray-into-web3/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm writing this in web2.

I own this domain (rbucks.com, although someday that might change) but I don't own the server hosting it. I don't have &lt;em&gt;absolute &lt;/em&gt;control over the data that I'm saving to it. I can delete it (more accurately, I can request that the host delete it) but it's possible the host could refuse or comply but keep a backup copy that I don't know about. More concerning, the host of this blog, wordpress.com, could accidentally erase this post and everything else I've written and saved on here. Then it would be gone. I don't have a backup (&lt;em&gt;edit: I do now&lt;/em&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I trust. I've read enough about (https://tim.blog/2015/02/09/matt-mullenweg/), the founder of WordPress, to believe that his company will keep my content safe. Why? Because &lt;em&gt;Capitalism&lt;/em&gt;. This is the social contract that makes WordPress worth billions of dollars. The software won't spontaneously delete my blog posts, and even if it did, WordPress would keep a backup for me, because of the incentive to remain valuable. (That being said, after sweating the end of my the paragraph, I downloaded a backup of this entire blog and saved it to my Google Drive!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the web2 world: &lt;em&gt;cloud-based platforms&lt;/em&gt;. These are clusters of powerful servers strung together across timezones, a patchwork of nodes and entrypoints programmed to distribute traffic so as to not overburden any one cluster. If a server goes down, it's simply removed from the cluster and another one is spun up. If a cluster goes down, traffic gets redirected somewhere else. Databases work the same way with writes synchronized almost instantaneously and reads distributed across a network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a good system. I like it. It works. I don't want to own or maintain my own blogging server anyway. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My friend Jake shared this post by Moxie titled, "(https://moxie.org/2022/01/07/web3-first-impressions.html)." It's a unique critique of the false promise of a completely decentralized web. That's what web3 means to me. It's the idea that we can shift those web2 clusters out of private control and into the hands of the public (or, really, the geeks and nerds who will be paid handsomely for hosting them). This way, everyone has a copy (or, really, everyone who wants one can get one) and we don't have to worry about one company going down or acting badly. It's a vision that means well, even if it's currently and always will be reliant on web2 infrastructure to function properly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moxie takes aim at non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and gas fees, noting that NFTs simply point to a storage address on a web2 server. He also notes that web3, by being decentralized, is inefficient and upgrades much slower than a centralized organization would. Interestingly, when it comes to speeding up blockchain reads, centralization has emerged organically, with two services copying the Ethereum blockchain onto a developer-friendly web2 system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having just read (https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25816925-the-evolution-of-everything) by Matt Ridley, with particular interest on his chapter, "The Evolution of Money," which hails bitcoin as the most important technological development in our lifetimes, I can relate Moxie's critique to Ridley's compliment. What we're witnessing is an evolution. Where Moxie dismisses the "early days" explanation of these hypocritical attributes of web3, Ridley would say the evolution is moving apace. Bitcoin was introduced ten years ago. For half that time it was completely obscure, known only to some fringe cryptology and technologists. As a technology, ten years is a long time, but as a cultural phenomenon, five years is nothing. When considering the promise of bitcoin and blockchain technology in general as a cultural shift, I think five years is too short. It is still very, very early and the impact has a long, long way to go. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started paying attention to bitcoin when social media caught notice. In other words, I became interested years &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; the first debates about the origin of Satoshi Nakamoto and years &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; my mother-in-law created her Coinbase account. Somewhere in the middle, say around 2014 and 2015.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bought my first Udemy course on Solidity (the programming language for Ethereum) in 2017. I got my first bit of bitcoin a year or two earlier, likely a gift from one of my avant-garde friends. Timing wasn't right for me then to chase the scent. I rode the bull run in 2017 and did some gifting of cryptocurrencies myself, amazed by the free money flowing into my Coinbase account. I tripled and quadrupled my (meager) principal and shrugged when one of my friends told me he was going to quit Dropbox and start a new blockchain. I continued to shrug when my other friends joined and they changed the company name from Loom to Solana investors started taking notice, purchasing the promise of a token distribution for hundreds of thousands and then millions of dollars, even in the depths of "crypto winter" when the then-sky high bitcoin prices fell back down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never considered working full-time in crypto then. I got an offer to (https://rbucks.com/2018/11/02/mightysignals-new-leadership/) and took it. Across the bay from my new house and two young kids, Solana took off, and so did everything else. They couldn't have timed their ICO better, launching the Solana token to the public just as the first drops of crytpo thaw began to emerge and accelerated into the incredible 2021 run that dwarfed the 2017 peaks ten-fold. My friends got rich! I did fine too, but (https://rbucks.com/2021/10/10/above-average-mediocrity/).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was engrossed in web2, a hired CEO struggling to get a foothold on the mountain of mobile data, feeling stuck. I managed to work my way to higher ground, selling MightySignal to Airnow in mid-2021. I'm there now, a modest web2 success. But when I'm not thinking about the next mountain to climb for MightySignal, I'm thinking about web3 and climate change. And here's where I get really excited. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't give a shit about today's implementation of NFTs. I think it's dumb. When I think about the promise of crypto, I think about public datasets. Which data, if made public, would make the world a better place? I had a weekly conversation with Jude Barry, a political strategist in the Bay Area, and my ideas and thinking evolved with these phone calls. I considered water rights, carbon offsets, energy bills, and philanthropic donations. Eventually I settled on campaign finance, and I couldn't let it go. It seemed like the perfect application of blockchain technology: an immutable ledger of gifts to political entities. Money could be traced from place to place. The public would see it, own it, and be able to hold the donors and recipients accountable. If ever there was a private database that ought to be made completely public, this was it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pursued this idea for months. I started thinking about payments and payment processing, and how companies like MightySignal would benefit from not having to pay 3% of revenue in credit card processing fees. On blockchain, these transfers have flat charges. There's no difference between a $10 or $10 million payment. Crypto disruption here makes perfect sense and I know people are working on it already. I turned back to politics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought about building a crypto-based clone of (https://secure.actblue.com/), helping political campaigns accept cryptocurrency donations, but instead of stopping there, we'd then track where the money goes and how much each campaign raised. It's a noble idea but is flawed in that campaigns could opt-out. There'd be nothing preventing them from exiting web3, going back into the black box of web2, and taking their web3 money with them. I stuck with it for months, though, discovering a new curiosity in the actual technology itself. I dusted off that Solidity course I purchased in 2017 and actually completed it. Meanwhile, I discovered crypto communities on Twitter and Discord. I lurked and read and talked to Jude and others. I spoke to two political campaigns about their interests in crypto and got lukewarm responses. It wasn't the crypto itself, they said, it's the reporting and regulation around it. If we could solve that operational challenge, we'd have a business. The only problem was I didn't want to build that. So I kept looking.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The year 2021 in California was a rough one. In the midst of a severe drought, with rampant wildfire smoke in the air, I watched my creek dry up. It scared me. My neighbors who lived here their entire lives said they've never seen it happen. Then in the fall, when the smoke cleared and rains returned, the COP 26 UN Climate Conference failed to reach consensus about what to do next. I read (https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52908942-how-to-avoid-a-climate-disaster) and did Al Gore's (https://www.climaterealityproject.org/training). Another idea began to emerge, a way to approach my political fundraising idea from the other side, creating an "activist investor"-type mechanism to influence the outcome, &lt;em&gt;our &lt;/em&gt;outcome, in this race against a climate disaster. It was beginning to look a lot like a PAC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This PAC would be different. It would be distributed, public, on a blockchain. It would collect funds from donors and place them into a smart contract. The contract would move the money if conditions where met, like a vote, an election, or any other trigger. I read about how to do this on blockchains using (https://chain.link/). It was starting to make sense, but then my wife, who used to track legislation for her job, poured a bit of cold water on the idea. Bills evolve, she said. You often can't know exactly what's going to be in the bill until after the votes are counted. Thus, a smart contract trigger might not really work. To trigger the transfer, we'd need a discussion and a vote. In crypto-speak, we'd need to make a distributed autonomous organization, or DAO. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This idea has become (https://daopac.github.io/White-Paper/).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our mission is to provide a counterweight to the dark money rampantly flowing into our political system by publicly pooling money from the people in order to win political fights for the common good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our vision is for the laws of the United States of America to accurately reflect the will of the people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;- DAOPAC White Paper&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blockchain comes into the picture by allowing us to create a codified escrow with some creative triggers. A regular escrow allows for the trustless swap of goods (e.g. Person A and Person B want to transact, but neither once to move first, so they rely on a trusted escrow to collect the item from each person and then redistribute.) We used an escrow when we bought our house, putting funds into escrow that would only be released when the seller signed their forms. On a blockchain, this can be done with code, taking money or keys or anything else digital from one party and only releasing them to another party when a condition is met. The difference is the escrow is basically this wide open public computer. Both parties can trust the escrow equally, and, importantly, there's no way that the escrow provider runs off with my down payment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In political fundraising, the escrow concept gets very interesting. A donor could put money into an escrow account (DAOPAC calls this a &lt;em&gt;campaign&lt;/em&gt;) that would be released if:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An elected official votes a certain way- An elected official gets a certain voter rating (e.g. League of Conservation Voters scorecard)- A candidate gets a specific endorsement- A candidate makes a specific statement on an issue- A candidate wins the primary- A candidate raises a certain amount of money&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the conditions aren't met, the money goes back to the donor automatically. This doesn't exist in the political world today. I think it should, because it's better for donors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also think it can be better for humanity. Since (https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/10/14/67-of-americans-perceive-a-rise-in-extreme-weather-but-partisans-differ-over-government-efforts-to-address-it/), I would like to see money being pooled and guaranteed for specific legislative outcomes. On the one hand, it's bribery, but on the other, it's how politics works. I give to politicians who vote the way I want them to vote. Does the cart push the horse? It's impossible to say, but to the extent that it does, it might as well be put on a blockchain for all to see. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is, in essence, the promise of web3. Data becomes publicly held. Sensitive private data can still be on a blockchain when it's encrypted using a safely stored private key. It's a really elegant way to think about the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category><category term="web3"></category><category term="blockchain"></category><category term="crypto"></category><category term="technology"></category><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>Why I run</title><link href="https://rbucks.com/2022/01/02/why-i-run/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-01-02T20:47:00-08:00</published><updated>2022-01-02T20:47:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Ryan Buckley</name></author><id>tag:rbucks.com,2022-01-02:/2022/01/02/why-i-run/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I run because I need to.

I need the exercise, I need the exhaustion, but most importantly, I need the time alone. I've found that I don't love running with other people. I'll do it because it makes me better at running and introduces me to new routes and possibilities, but I'm happiest when I run alone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I run because it feels good. I'm pushing 40 now and my achilles and ankles take a few minutes to warm up. I feel them when I take those first few steps down my driveway. I know that the little aches and pains will go away within 10 minutes. I'll be just over a mile away from my house by then, and happy to have at least another hour ahead of me. A good run for me takes about an hour and a half. That's when the little bits of pain start to return, but in different places. I'll feel it first at the bottom of my feet. My heel will get a dull ache, and then that bony ball below my toes will join the chorus. This is when I know I've reached the outer limits of my running fitness. It usually comes after about two hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;!({static}/images/56EB400D-BC3B-4BC6-B7E2-A76C403A5692_1_105_c.jpeg)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I run because it's fun to explore. I enjoy not knowing exactly where I'm going. When I discover a new route, I set out in a general direction uphill, figuring that two sides of a ridge must connect to a trail or road somewhere. I'll consult my Strava app's heat maps to make sure I have some hope of finding a loop, but once I'm out there I mostly rely on instinct. I did this a month ago, trying to turn the eight miles back from a park where my family took holiday pictures into a twelve-mile mostly trail run. I set on Bollinger Canyon Road, noting that after a few miles it appeared to dead-end into a trailhead. However, a neighbor told me there's a bunch of No Trespassing signs and some folks who aren't used to having visitors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deciding to trust Google and Strava more than my neighbor, I turned up that road and sweated my way to the end of it. I ran past dirt driveways and gurgling streams, through oak forests and grassy fields. Finally the road ended at a gate and a couple of dirt driveways. I met two guys there who looked at me inquisitively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"You &lt;em&gt;ran&lt;/em&gt; all the way up this road?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Yessir. I'm looking for a trail."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Well, there ain't no trail past here."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn't believe him but I didn't push it. I ran back down the road, knowing that just on the other side of the ridge to the north I would find the network of trails on my map. When those guys were out of sight, I headed up a dirt driveway and followed it as far up the hill as I could before it turned into a much more private road close to someone's house. Seeing no semblance of a hiking trail anywhere, I turned around once more and headed back to the main road. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About a quarter of a mile down, I decided to try again. This time it was a fire road that went straight up a steep grassy hillside in exactly the direction I needed to head. I set out, hopped a railing and climbed up to another cattle gate. Beyond it was the ridge, and on the ridge, I saw another trail heading toward the neighborhood of my daughter's elementary school. I figured I would be able to get back on a road over there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the ridge I looked to the north and west. It's another world. A small ranch and pond, another ridge with a few houses overlooking the valley. Clusters of oak trees and waves of green, flowing grass. I smiled on the inside. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why I run. &lt;/p&gt;

Nonetheless, I edited and finished it because I think the vibe is interesting and might be helpful to another fellow "bottom of the top 1%"-er. *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;So here we go.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm going to chip off a piece of the feeling I described in my previous posts, (https://rbucks.com/2021/03/24/its-been-a-long-long-time/) and (https://rbucks.com/2021/07/19/my-unannounced-and-inconsequential-break-from-social-media/), and dissect it a bit more, just for fun. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Delusions of grandeur&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, I had big plans, big ambitions. "Three million by 30," is what I used to tell myself in my mid-to-late 20s when my (https://rbucks.com/2019/02/01/the-bitter-taste-of-failure/) was starting up in San Francisco. I figured three million dollars at six percent interest (conservative investments) would yield $180,000 per year. I could retire with that annuity if I wanted to (but of course I wouldn't). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believed I was destined for greatness, that all I had to do was put one foot in front of the other and I'd walk my way, chest puffed and bent arms swinging, to the top of the heap. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recalled a mentor at UC Berkeley meeting my girlfriend at the time at a fancy banquet. When I introduced him to her he smiled and pointed at me. "He's going to be rich," he said to her. I never forgot that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was leading some environmental programs at UC Berkeley I remember one of the campus facilities leaders introduced me to her peers as the future governor of California. I don't remember what I was there to talk about, but I remember she said that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was in high school, I sat in the right rear seat of a car while my friend's mom drove. My friend sat in front of me, on the passenger side. Out of the blue, his mom turned around at a red light and told me she'll vote for me when I run for governor. Another friend, someone I volunteered with at a community organization in high school, also reminds people we meet that I'll be governor someday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Governor. Someday. Sigh. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The older I get, the harder it is to live up to these lofty expectations. It's as if my first two decades were a dream where everyone I knew seemed to anticipate my gilded future. Now I'm awake, two decades later, and those things I was told were supposed to happen haven't happened. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've worked hard. I've put one foot in front of the other. But the fortune and fame have not materialized. I'm not at the top of the heap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, I find myself at the bottom of the top 1-ish percent, a no man's land of far more than most but far, far, far away from the best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;Pride and punishment&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know I shouldn't care. Sometimes I really truly honestly don't, and those days are wonderful. Sometimes that feeling of freedom from expectation and comparison lasts for a week. In that time I'm at peace. I don't want, I don't need. I'm content with my work, my assets, and my friends and family. My lot is just fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then I get a LinkedIn or Twitter alert. A guy I know from graduate school is listing his company on the NASDAQ. A friend from college has a top position in the Biden administration. Another one sold his company for $30 million, has $500 million in cryptocurrency tokens, or a hundred thousand Twitter followers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think about the companies I've started and sold for barely a fraction of those amounts. I look at my bank account, Twitter likes, blog visits, and crypto portfolio. I ask myself what I've been doing, why I missed those opportunities, started the wrong companies, bought the wrong stocks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it comes on a phone call. Just a regular check in with an old friend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Oh, you're still doing that?" &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"You're going to sell for what?" &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"You can't join the syndicate? It's just $30,000."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And suddenly I'm inadequate. It corkscrews my intestines. It impacts my mood. I get off the call and just think. I cross my arms across my chest and stare at the wall, lost in thought, feeling bad about myself for feeling bad about myself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tell myself to let the feelings cycle through. I chew them up, like I'm digesting them, and explore the colors and textures, shapes and smells. I've mulled over these so much in the last few months, and I'm finally, finally able to get them out. A long-awaited defecation of self-destructive emotional waste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm a proud person. I want for myself what many people along the way have also wanted for me: above average success. I went to Berkeley, Harvard, and MIT. I started companies, sold them, got married, started a family, bought a house. I'm a good leader and a great husband and father. I know these things and I'm proud of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also recognize that it's the same forces that got me this far that keep me from settling down. I haven't lost the lust to have a "great" career. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what's a "great" career and how is it measured? I'm still figuring that out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Personal greatness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The opinions that matter most to me are my wife's and kids'. It's been that way since I became a husband and a dad and I know that I'm doing A+ work there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't compare myself to other dads. How can I? I don't know what happens when their front doors close. I don't know if they fight or yell or ignore their kids all evening while staring at the TV or their phones. But I really truly doubt it. Either way, it has no bearing on me (but I'm glad, for my neighborhood's sake, that my fellow fathers all seem to be very good at this parenting thing.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I have no father FOMO. When I see a happy family walking through my neighborhood with beautiful, happy children, it warms my insides. I want to meet them, let some of their good vibes rub off on me, and make a new friend. I want them to come over for dinner, to invite the dad to a creek campfire, to celebrate each other's good fortune to be raising a family right here, right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's no jealousy at all, so I have what I might call a "dad swagger." I'm confident, happy, and friendly with every dad I meet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Professional greatness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not the same for me professionally. I compare myself to everyone and feign a smile through the bitter taste of jealousy when someone has achieved something that I want. This is the punishment for my pride, the thing I'm improving upon but still dealing with. It's the shit I need to extricate after chewing on it for years but really being aware of it for the last few months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't cap off my corporate career until I've maxed out my earning potential. I have another company or two left to build, run, and sell. I think about it &lt;em&gt;all &lt;/em&gt;the time. I mean &lt;em&gt;all &lt;/em&gt;the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the one hand, it's good. I'm ambitious. But on the other, it impacts my appreciation of right now. My professional aspirations are future-facing. My personal ones are right now. I'm happy with right now, but I lust for the future. It beckons me, like a siren song, to be smarter, get luckier, try harder, work longer, and get the big break I've been craving since we first started Scripted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know I'll regret not giving myself the opportunity to be a founder or super early employee of a unicorn (that's a company with a $1 billion valuation, for you non-tech people). Odds are not in my favor that it happens, and I'm okay with that, but I need to try. This is my next Harvard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I'm preparing. (https://rbucks.com/2021/01/08/welcome-letter-to-my-search-marketing-class/) is one way of prepping myself. Taking classes on Solidity and anything else I find interesting is another. I also find that exercise does wonders for my energy and creativity, so I'm working out a lot and treating my body well. This process is taking time, but I'm enjoying it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the next big break opportunity comes, I'll jump on it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Political opportunities&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someday I will retire as a politician and get back into teaching and writing. I know this for sure. What happens between now and then is still up in the air. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm 39 now, going on 40. That's still pretty young but also pretty damn old. I once believed I needed to be running for something or already in office by my 40th birthday. I've given myself another decade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I met a MIT Media Lab guy who ran for congress in Southern California. He's very impressive and working on fundraising software and blockchain technology now. He told me that his 30s were about "me" and his 40s will be about "we." He's going to do one company only and focus on his family for the next decade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel like my 30s were "we" (especially since my first kid was born when I was 32) and my 40s will be a little bit more "me" but still mostly "we" and my 50s will be downright selfish as I'll definitely be in politics by then, fully immersed in the whole scene. All of it. The dinners, the ceremonies, the late-night dinners and networking. I'll be all over it once my kids have moved out of the house when I'm in my early 50s.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll be a good politician. I might even be a great one. Time will tell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Until then&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day at a time. That's it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category><category term="personal"></category><category term="reflection"></category><category term="ambition"></category><category term="career"></category><category term="life-lessons"></category></entry><entry><title>In memory of Irving Katuna</title><link href="https://rbucks.com/2021/05/08/in-memory-of-irving-katuna/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-05-08T12:17:00-07:00</published><updated>2021-05-08T12:17:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Ryan Buckley</name></author><id>tag:rbucks.com,2021-05-08:/2021/05/08/in-memory-of-irving-katuna/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Edit: I've turned this blog post into a eulogy that I'll give at Rossmoor for my grandpa's funeral.

He passed away early in the morning on Tuesday, April 27, 2021.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My grandpa, Irving Katuna, was born on January 12, 1929 in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. It was a Saturday, and it was cold. A light dusting of snow passed through Pennsylvania the previous night and the temperature stayed just above freezing the day he was born. I'm not sure how many of his dozen older siblings were still living in the house then, but I picture my infant grandfather passed around to plenty of happy hands when he arrived home from the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wilkes-Barre is a coal mining town about 120 miles west of New York City. Its population swelled to a peak of 80,000 around 1930 and declined through the depression and the aftermath of World War II. My grandpa was 11 when the draft was instituted in 1940 and was still too young to serve when the draft ended in 1946. Only about 30,000 people live in Wilkes-Barre today. Industry left, and so did my grandpa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He matriculated to UCLA but graduated from UC Berkeley and settled in San Francisco. He was the first of his siblings to go to college, a unique opportunity that did not go unnoticed by his older brothers. But in addition to being the youngest, he also was born with a stunted right arm, a midwife's mishap made during delivery at the hospital that cold Saturday in Wilkes-Barre, which prevented him from helping at the feed store his family owned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He met my grandma, Berna Mendell, at a dance at the Hillel in San Francisco while he was studying history at Cal. They quickly married and had four children: Linda (my mom), Judy, Bruce, and Brad. Along the way, he earned a Master's degree from San Francisco State and attempted a Ph.D. but did not submit a thesis. He began his career as a teacher and became a vice principal at Benjamin Franklin Junior High School in the Fillmore District before returning once again to the classroom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My grandpa's Jewish faith, along with his many years teaching Black students, brought him to Selma, Alabama in 1964. He accompanied five rabbis to support the Montgomery bus boycott and show solidarity of the Jewish community with a popular Christian pastor named Martin Luther King, Jr. My grandpa and these rabbis marched and were imprisoned with Dr. King. He spent less than a week in Selma but it would leave an impression on him and his family for the rest of his life. We celebrated his trip to Selma for his 80th birthday, and at 92 he had just completed writing a book about it with support from my mom and cousin Lisa.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My grandpa was opinionated and curious. He was a docent at the San Francisco Academy of Sciences and loved to buy books at thrift shops, a few of which he actually read. He liked pastries for breakfast and would go out of his way to pick up a scone or a bear claw from his favorite bakery. Breakfast at home usually involved cereal, which he kept in neat airtight plastic bins, and he preferred to eat it with fruit salad on top. On special occasions, like when his grandson stayed over, he made french toast in the morning. He enjoyed jogging and playing tennis, and when age forced him to hang up his running shoes, he returned to his lifelong love of swimming. He was a natural leader, someone who tended to reside over the organizations he volunteered for. He loved to join elder hostels, especially in Ashland, Oregon, where he attended the Shakespeare Festival with his wife Thelma for many years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My grandpa eventually left San Francisco and settled here in Rossmoor where he and Thelma became members of local Democratic and Jewish organizations and discovered the best local Chinese restaurants. Lucid and curious until the end, Irving loved to read and talk to his family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My house is only a couple of miles away from his apartment here and over the last few years we settled into a routine of bringing Chinese food over and eating dinner together: sweet and sour fish filets for Thelma, tomato beef chow mein for Irv, and vegetable chow mein for me and my girls. When COVID hit, I'd drop the food off and leave, aware that I wouldn't know which of these dinners would be our last. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grandpa Irv was immensely proud of all of us. And we were proud of him too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Farewell, Grandpa Irv. We will miss you.&lt;/p&gt;

We called it the piano room because it's where we put my grandmother's piano. This was a behemoth of a piano -- a beautiful black seven-foot long Baldwin parlor grand -- and it weighed a metric ton. It hardly fit, so a few years later, we swapped it for a Yamaha Clavinova. Now my piano has a volume control and stands against the wall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;!({static}/images/A20C1926-F200-425C-8159-BF7FD7634AA9-1024x768.jpg)
&lt;strong&gt;Too much piano for a small house&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the songs I decided to learn to sing is this one, "It's Been A Long, Long Time," by Bing Crosby and Les Paul. I first heard it on Spotify, and it touched me. The guitar is beautiful, the lyrics are haunting, and the purity of just Bing's voice and Les's guitar is magical. I've been on a WW1 and WW2 movie-watching kick for a while and I figured that this song was about the war. A quick google search confirmed my hunch. (Another one that would be obvious, if you listened closely, is "I'll Be Home For Christmas.") &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I learned the chords and the lovely guitar solo and took it to my piano and vocal teacher and asked her to work with me on it. We spent a few weeks improving my tone and breathing through the high notes and then moved on to other songs, but this one still has a special place in my heart. And that sentiment has only deepened over the last two momentous years.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I write this, my dog is five and a half years old. He's middle-aged, just like me, and he's sore after our long jogs. My oldest daughter is six, and she's lanky and has a big gap-toothed smile. I still remember her smiling to herself, asleep in a crib in San Francisco, her arm stretched out in that baby sleeping pose. I knew then that she'd be a happy kid, and she is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;!({static}/images/2CC8C2A1-BBAF-4B5A-A3B8-36A04E98D132-1024x768.jpg)
&lt;strong&gt;A smiling baby Lily&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My youngest is now four years old. She's sassy, strong, and increasingly independent. Before the pandemic, we followed her around everywhere, protecting her fall. She was barely three years old then. Within weeks of the lockdowns we let her out of sight, playing with our neighbors at the end of our cul-de-sac. Now she's even more mobile, on a bike, a scooter, a skateboard, or rollerblades. I couldn't keep up if I tried, so I don't. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, it's been a long, long time since I've changed a diaper. I'm grateful for that, and also sad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sold our BOB jogging stroller last weekend. I can't count how many miles I pushed that thing. It would be in the hundreds. We went all over the northern flats and hills of San Francisco, along Crissy Field and up into the Presidio. My runs got longer when we (https://rbucks.com/2016/03/22/an-ode-to-the-suburbs/). I jogged that stroller to preschool, daycare, and elementary school. Countless trips to Noah's Bagels with plain reduced fat smears stuffed into the pockets on our way home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm now a dad without a stroller. It took six years, but it happened fast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;figure&gt;!({static}/images/819EAEDF-D0B4-40BA-B246-50B1D73F78C5-768x1024.jpg)- !({static}/images/44A5C7D3-C65D-4023-B16F-947D48464691-1024x768.jpg)- !({static}/images/93C3A95A-8FFF-4CC8-86EE-4BB6F044FE93-768x1024.jpg)- !({static}/images/0D5D2ABA-CA6A-449B-8DA1-8586726EDDAD-1024x768.jpg)
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When my neighborhood dad friends get together and drink beers by a fire in one of our backyards, I'm reminded that I'm the old guy now. Most of my neighbors are still having kids, planning on having more. They're in their early to mid-30s. I'm at the end of that decade. I moved into this neighborhood before them. Now I'm the one who knows the history, who lived in what house and has since moved away. That's crazy to me. When I first moved here there were other guys who knew the lore. Now I'm one of them. The old guard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been running MightySignal longer than I was at the Harvard Kennedy School. I've been living in Saranap longer than I was at UC Berkeley. All of these experiences are stacking on top of each other like loaded bricks and sometimes they weigh down on me. What does it all mean? What's it supposed to mean? Does it mean anything? I don't know. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently I've been going through a transition. I have too much on the line right now to say exactly what it's about, but it has involved months of debate with myself and friends who will listen. There's a longer post to be written about this, and I will get to it (I look forward to multiple sittings on this one), but it all boils down to this same refrain: "It's Been A Long, Long Time." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been alive for a long, long time. I've been an adult for a long, long time. I've been out of grad school for a long, long time. My kids are older, I'm older, and in many ways, I'm able to do whatever I want. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I (https://rbucks.com/2019/09/19/a-few-days-of-radioactive-seclusion/) around around this time last year, I told myself not to overthink it. I was going to write a novel, simple as that. I wasn't going to agonize over plot lines and details. I wasn't going to do any reader panels. I wasn't writing for fame, after all, but rather to try something new. Prior to diving into this project I hadn't done &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; creative writing. None. In a long time, at least a decade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had the spark of an idea. I'd been thinking about it a lot. I knew the premise: *Man gets sick and is certain to die. Man hears about a faraway adventure hospice and decides to go, leaving his family behind. Man regrets. Man dies. *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought about the characters, the setting, and how agonizing this decision would be for everyone involved. It felt like there was a lot of meat on this bone and when I shared that much of the story with family and friends, their eyebrows raised. They were immediately intrigued and it spurred all kinds of questions, and even some disgust. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I can't believe anyone would do that! Would &lt;em&gt;you &lt;/em&gt;do that to your wife and family?" Probably not, actually, but I loved that my plot elicited that type of reaction. It meant readership and book groups once it was published. And it meant it would be fun, even easy, to write. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was right and wrong. It has been fun. It has not been easy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Observation #1: It's the main character, stupid&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Story Genius by Lisa Cron&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was about 40,000 words into it, I read (https://www.amazon.com/Story-Genius-Science-Outlining-Riveting/dp/1607748894) by Lisa Cron and loved it. Around the time I started the novel I also read (https://www.amazon.com/Save-Last-Book-Screenwriting-Youll/dp/1932907009/) on the recommendation of a neighbor. Both touch on the same theme: &lt;em&gt;character, character, character&lt;/em&gt;. Plots are just things that happen. Characters are what we remember. Characters are what we care about. Characters are what actually drives the story and makes the plot &lt;em&gt;matter&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we read a great novel, we emote as the main character struggles with a misguided belief that drives him against the roiling ocean that is the plot. We feel him as he makes decisions and rejoice as he evolves, becoming a new person at the end. This is the formula that the most commercially successful novels and screenplays use to sell copies and &lt;em&gt;move&lt;/em&gt; people. You want your reader immersed in your story, rooting for or enamored with your character. You want them invested through to the last page, and you want your story to be a real gift to them. For those five or six hours the reader spent with you, they got a real glimpse into another world, a new universe, a sidecar's view into something extraordinary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humans seem to be uniquely able to get wrapped up fiction. The story is a device unlike any other. It takes us away from one reality and places us into another one. It's science fiction, but it's just words on paper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Observation #2: Writing fiction is dreaming while awake&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting "in the zone" on a piece of fiction is much different than feeling the same effect while writing non-fiction, as I typically do on this blog. When I get in the mood to write, as I did tonight, I can flow for a good 45 minutes, finishing a post in one sitting. During that time I'm focused. I feel good. Basically, I just feel like writing, and the ideas come and I jot them down and the sentences just write themselves with very little editing. But I'm very much awake. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flow of creative writing is much different. At peak flow, I'm barely there. I'm fully engaged with the story. For those moments, the characters are real and I'm in it, watching them talk and make decisions, trying to take notes as fast and as best I can. I've cried while writing, which is actually an incredible experience. Two people who read early drafts of this novel told me they cried too. I wonder if we cried at the same part. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best analogy I can offer is it's like a dream, except you're awake. You're aware that you're awake, because you're working hard, furiously trying to record it in writing, which is maybe the thing that makes it most distinct from a real dream. But during those moments you're a voyeur, a spy, a fly on the wall and your mind is working in two dimensions at once but it's just buzzing on a creative writing high. That feeling is addictive. I wish I could say that it happens every time I sit down and write. It does not, but now that I know it's there, I keep holding out for it to show up again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This insight is one reason that I keep chipping away at this novel. It also helps me to justify my writing retreats. I know that getting there requires open mental space, the long runway of an open afternoon where my only obligation is to use that time to write. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Observation #3: Decision fatigue is real&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other big difference about non-fiction and fiction writing is the exponentially greater number of decisions that must be made in a fiction story. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever the topic is of my non-fiction piece (business, usually), I have a framework to follow. There's a set of facts and my decision-making is simply around how I describe my observations, what references to make, and how deep I want to go. (By the way, for some of the best non-fiction writing I've found, check out (https://alexdanco.com/).)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great non-fiction writing is academic but accessible. It might also weave a storyline through it, using some of the character techniques described in Observation #1. For the epitome of that technique, look no further than Alexander Hamilton's biography or the musical inspired by it. Laden with facts, it had to decide what to keep and what to ignore, what to expand upon and what to merely mention in passing. These are big decisions, no doubt, but not as many as would have been made if Alexander Hamilton were a purely fiction character. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dealing with decision fatigue is actually what originally led me to the second observation. In the flow state, decisions feel like they're being made for me. Even though I'm writing a fiction, in the "dream" I have as I write, the story just happens and I simply record it, like a biographer reviewing source material for his subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can manufacture it in some ways by basing a character on someone I know, much the way an artist uses a living model for a painting or sculpture. I can make fewer decisions this way, letting my memory of that person take the reins. It helps me save energy for the scenes when I don't have an experience to run them against. These take real work, a bit of googling, and progress the slowest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm 72,000 words into what should be an 80,000-word novel. The last 10 percent has been the hardest. I'm stuck on the ending. I thought I had it, but now I'm not so sure, and I'm aware that if I deviate too far, I'll either end up having to rewrite a good portion before this ending or extend the novel out another 20-30,000 words. Neither outcome is appealing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this is what I think about when I go to bed, when I swim laps, and when I'm mindlessly throwing the ball from my (https://rbucks.com/2017/06/19/the-ascent-of-blue/). Because ultimately that's what writing a novel is. It's getting absorbed in it, thinking about it, and knocking out some of the thousand hours it takes to write a book that will get consumed 200x faster. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's the glory in writing a novel. "It's the journey, not the destination" has never felt more true.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category><category term="writing"></category><category term="creativity"></category><category term="personal"></category><category term="reflection"></category><category term="goals"></category></entry><entry><title>Personal, Perceptible, Practical</title><link href="https://rbucks.com/2020/03/28/personal-perceptible-practical/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-03-28T06:52:00-07:00</published><updated>2020-03-28T06:52:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Ryan Buckley</name></author><id>tag:rbucks.com,2020-03-28:/2020/03/28/personal-perceptible-practical/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Some time ago I learned about Susan Solomon, the atmospheric chemist who discovered that chlorofluorocarbons (a.k.a.

CFCs) caused the huge hole in the ozone layer. Remember all that noise about this from the 90s? It went away because of Dr. Solomon. She received her PhD from UC Berkeley and she is currently still teaching and still doing atmospheric research at MIT. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been thinking about something she said about the tactics she used to get the world to care and do something about the problem. I was struck that she thought as much about the "marketing" of the ozone layer problem as the science behind it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;!(https://www.pbs.org/wnet/peril-and-promise/files/2019/04/3_SusanSolomonV2-768x432.png)
&lt;em&gt;Susan Solomon at MIT. Credit: (https://www.pbs.org/wnet/peril-and-promise/2019/04/how-the-ozone-hole-can-help-us-communicate-climate-change/)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solomon said that effective environmental problem solving requires that the solution be &lt;strong&gt;personal&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;perceptible&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;practical&lt;/strong&gt;. I'd argue that this framework works for any problem, public or private, economic or environmental. It's relevant even when rallying the globe around fending off a global pandemic, too. I keep coming back to this when I read about the response to coronavirus, so let's apply Dr. Solomon's framework to our current global crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make people relate. Help individuals understand how the problem relates to them personally. Not the world, or the rainforests, or the spotted owls. Biologically, we are wired to care about #1 (ourselves) and although we can all point to examples of selfless behavior, on average, we're selfish. Rather than fight that tendency, make it work for the cause. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The harrowing stories of frontline health workers ring louder than the pleas of politicians. Doctors and nurses have an effective way of making things personal. Shelter in place to protect your family, your community, your own health. It also helps that nurses consistently rank among the (https://news.gallup.com/poll/180260/americans-rate-nurses-highest-honesty-ethical-standards.aspx). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Perceptible&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Help people understand the units of measurement. In the case of coronavirus, it's the number of tests, cases, and deaths. Charts fly around Twitter comparing rates of infection by country, often on logarithmic scales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The early challenge with coronavirus is that people who don't study math or economics don't have an appreciation for exponential growth. We all probably think we know what it means, but early dismissal of the risks show that most of us don't appreciate its gravity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason coronavirus spread so quickly is the same reason why you can't fold a paper in half more than eight times. It doesn't matter if you're folding a playing card or a football field. The reason is the thickness of the folds increases exponentially. After that eighth fold, no matter how thin it is to begin with (I mean, you need to be able to feel it), the material you'd need to fold is simply too thick. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To apply this principal to the spread of a virus, the number of initial vectors is like the thickness of the flat piece of paper. The more vectors, the thicker your piece of paper, so as you fold it and the vectors go out and infect, your thickness grows faster. The analogy of a really thin piece of paper is having just a few vectors, maybe just one, in a rural area, so he can't infect very many people very quickly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You're starting with smaller numbers, so you might get more folds in. But exponential growth eventually looks the same, no matter how small the base. This is the perceptibility challenge we faced with coronavirus. Fortunately, it has helped that testing kit production is ramped up and we can see the exponential activity clearer now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Circling back to the environmental application, when scientists were able to measure the rate of growth of the ozone hole and capture icebergs collapsing into the Arctic Ocean, people started to care. When the ban on CFCs went into effect and measurements showed the hole closing up, it reinforced the global community's behavior. Now it's no longer a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, the feedback cycles on the coronavirus are even shorter than they are with the ozone hole. Effects of social distancing and lockdowns will be measured within two weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, this is the most important of the three. I believe the business adage that you can't fix what you can't measure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practical&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make the solution easy to understand. People don't want to think too hard. And if you're asking for a lot, then problem should be very personal and very perceptible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, this is where we really succumb to the human condition. Unlike many environmentalists I know, I don't think it's practical for everyone to give up meat and dairy products. Being 100% off fossil fuels is also not practical. But switching out the chemical in an aerosol can or using a product with a different applicator, as the ask was during the ozone crisis, is definitely practical. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today the asks are huge. One billion people are restricted from congregating. Schools are closed. Small businesses are shut down. Public transportation ridership dropped by 90% in the Bay Area as employees were forced to work from home. The scale of this impact is mind-numbing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do believe this is the right solution, though, and my neighbors agree. These measures are practical in that they're easy to comprehend and it's easy to understand how they will help. With daily reports coming out about the spread of the virus, we're able to follow along as community by community we "flatten the curve" on the epidemic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So to sum it up, for me to get behind an action, I have to relate to it, be able to track progress, and have a well-defined way to contribute. When I first heard of this framework I thought it was a brilliant tool for activists to use. I never imagined that I'd experience a global pandemic, and it's interesting to see how this framework applies in this most extreme of circumstances too.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category><category term="personal"></category><category term="reflection"></category><category term="entrepreneurship"></category><category term="business-strategy"></category><category term="advice"></category></entry><entry><title>Read Write Play: Q3 2019</title><link href="https://rbucks.com/2019/11/18/read-write-play-q3-2019/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-11-18T22:11:00-08:00</published><updated>2019-11-18T22:11:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Ryan Buckley</name></author><id>tag:rbucks.com,2019-11-18:/2019/11/18/read-write-play-q3-2019/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In just a couple of months I will have been tracking my RWP for two years.

Not bad for a silly little trope that nobody (except me) cares about. I try to be consistent in what I do, though, and being conscious of the RWP is just as important to me as the RWP itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To put it another way, when there's so much noise, so much to care about and be stressed out about and want to care about, it's nice to be able to shove it all aside because I've already distilled it all down to three things that actually matter. Indeed, these three things that are always going to be alone-time well-spent: Reading, writing, and playing (music). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Read&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I basically failed my design curriculum. I really meant to get into it, but I got distracted. I'm not sure if or when I'll pick it back up. I want to learn to draw better, but that kind of itch is getting scratched by my piano playing, which I'll describe below. I feel like that's my physical art, and when my kids are drawing, I can be in the same room with them playing piano. It's what I want to do and it makes me happy, so I'm not going to fight it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, I started reading (https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10464006-save-the-cat), a book about screenwriting that could be applied to any kind of writing. It was recommended to me by a neighbor and I thought it prudent since I am working on my first novel and am about halfway through writing it. Save The Cat has good ideas about character and story development. I think about it as I edit my half-written novel. I'm also about halfway through Save The Cat. Someday I will finish it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One night I didn't feel like working or watching television or playing chess. I pulled up the Kindle Store and quickly settled in on (https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40180098-the-overstory) by Richard Powers. It's a long book. It took me about three weeks of reading at night to get through it, and I thought the ending dragged on a ways, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. It's a book about people and the environment. More specifically, it's about different peoples' interactions with trees. Many parts of the book are moving and beautiful. The writing reminds me of Paulo Coelho or Gabriel García Márquez. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As soon as I finished &lt;em&gt;The Overstory&lt;/em&gt;, I started reading a book, (https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29507568-the-hidden-life-of-trees) by Peter Wohlleben, that Richard Powers referenced. I'll write more about this book next time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, true to form, I read one long book in Q3. The march continues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Write&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm happy to report that there was a lot of writing happening in Q3 2019! I started a novel and gave a 5,000 word speech at Diablo Valley College. If I include the smattering of blog posts I bet I wrote more than 40,000 words last quarter. That's a hefty amount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mentioned my novel in this blog post about the (https://rbucks.com/2019/09/19/a-few-days-of-radioactive-seclusion/) I had to endure in August 2019. This wasn't a physical hardship. There was some mental stress, I suppose, but fortunately everything worked out fine, and I got to take advantage of a "doctor's orders" excuse to be secluded with my dad at my family's cabin (https://rbucks.com/2019/03/03/my-happy-place/). I had four nights and five days up there, able to set my own schedule, unbound by the family routine back home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used this reprieve to start a novel that had been banging around in my head for months. I wrote a short outline and gave myself at least five hours each day to sit and write. In all I cranked out over 25,000 words and I managed to write another 7,000 after I got home. Progress has slowed down significantly since then, but I'm not too worried about it. I'll pick it back up at a writing retreat or something similar this winter. I really want to get the first draft done. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of the reason it stalled is I had another writing project, a big speech at Diablo Valley College. I (https://rbucks.com/2019/09/11/four-simple-truths-about-entrepreneurship/). I had over an hour to stand in front of a bunch of people and talk. I did the math and figured if I had no slides, I would need a speech of about 5,000 words to fill that time. So, I wrote it. I felt pretty good about how it all went. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That speech and my follow-up post about (https://rbucks.com/2019/09/18/dealing-with-public-speaking-panic-attacks/) performed relatively well on my blog. My personal favorite, though, is the post I wrote (https://rbucks.com/2019/10/17/becoming-a-better-public-singer/) with my neighbors on one sunny day at the end of summer. I really enjoyed it. The blog post has some videos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Play&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In September I bid farewell to the Baldwin 7 foot parlor grand piano that I inherited from my grandparents. It just wasn't practical to have a piano this size in our small home. And although we kept it for nearly four years, it was time to let it go and let the room where we kept it turn into something else. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still needed a piano, of course, and looked all around for good uprights. I played some at the Music Exchange in Walnut Creek but since the grand was all I knew, these pianos just didn't sound right. They were tinny and shrill compared to the broad, warm tones of my Baldwin. It was really disappointing to make the step down. Then, one day at Music Exchange, I sat down at one of the Yamaha Clavinova digital pianos in the showroom. I loved it. I loved everything about it. The weighted keys, the tone, the look, the sound. Best of all, they were priced the same as a used upright piano. I had to convince my wife that this wasn't some dinky synthesizer, that it was basically the same thing as an upright piano, except a lot better. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She agreed to trust me and I was able to find a family in Alamo who had the space and the desire for our piano. I sold it and with money to spare I bought the Clavinova. I'd like to say I miss my grandparents' piano, but I don't. I love the Clav, and since I can adjust the volume and play piano in the same room where my girls are drawing, I play a lot more. Like, a LOT more. This is all that would have mattered to my grandparents. They just want to know that music is being played. I know it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;figure&gt;!({static}/images/75e3344b-d2e8-4b2a-8273-e971326eb94a.jpg?w=1024)- !({static}/images/a20c1926-f200-425c-8159-bf7fd7634aa9.jpg?w=1024)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;After and before.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I paused my piano lessons while this transition took place. When I contacted my piano teacher again, I was happy to introduce her to two new pupils: my wife and my oldest daughter. All of my piano practicing has finally paid off: two more people are learning to play. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, I'm going over the same songs I've been playing since the first RWP, but doing a lot better. I've been wanting to play Bennie and The Jets for years. Just this past month I settled in and focused on it, and I had it down within a week. I'm now able to play multiple inversions of common chords by sight. Crazy chords like F#m7 will trip me up, but I'm seeing now how relative minors factor in. That F#m7 chord has the same notes as an A chord. So I play an A, which I already know, and put an F# octave on the base. Boom: F#m7. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also continue to sing along with the Elton John tunes, even though they're out of my range. I keep hoping one day I'll wake up and be able to sing a high G as well as Billy Joel, but that day hasn't come yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm still playing guitar too, mostly because my oldest daughter has become &lt;em&gt;obsessed&lt;/em&gt; with The Beatles. It's the cutest thing, and a proud dad moment for me. I bought a book of Beatles songs on a whim at a music shop near my house that was closing. I figured it'd be nice to have on hand. What I couldn't have known then, and what I still can't believe, is that my daughter would use this book to teach herself to read by listening to Beatles songs and following the lyrics. Often, instead of asking Alexa, I'll play along on guitar and sing with her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight, when I put her to bed, we sang "You Like Me Too Much" and "Here Comes The Sun." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The girl loves George Harrison.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category><category term="reading"></category><category term="writing"></category><category term="music"></category><category term="self-improvement"></category><category term="personal"></category></entry><entry><title>The things we all want</title><link href="https://rbucks.com/2019/07/06/the-things-we-all-want/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-07-06T07:08:00-07:00</published><updated>2019-07-06T07:08:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Ryan Buckley</name></author><id>tag:rbucks.com,2019-07-06:/2019/07/06/the-things-we-all-want/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yesterday was July 4, and on this day for the last four decades my neighborhood has held a day-long celebration of community and country, in that particular order.

I was reminded how much this neighborhood is cherished by an older woman I sat next to. Her son-in-law was raised on the street where we spoke, and his mom still owns that house. He raised his family across the street and helped his daughter buy and remodel the house right behind us. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some neighborhoods chew you up and spit you out, never wanting to look back. Some are like a cradle that you never want to leave. This neighborhood is that kind of neighborhood. The preferred method of leaving is being carried out feet first. The daughter of the original owner of our house told me that was her mom's plan. And her mom got her wish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So on this day, long after the bicycle and scooter parade, sometime between the water balloon toss and bubble gum blowing contest, I stood with a dad I recognized from a few streets over. He worked in finance in London and, since I just happened to a read an &lt;em&gt;Economist&lt;/em&gt; article detailing the importance of London as a financial trading center, particularly in derivatives (which it turned out he traded), we got to talking about Brexit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He believed the whole thing was ridiculous, that clearly the Leavers hadn't thought through the impacts of breaking close financial ties with Europe and the devastating impact it would have on the economy, supply chains, and the financial markets he traded in. He want on to qualify his disgust, though, by saying that the underlying problems are real. Much like the populist wave here in the United States, Londoners and Brits are also feeling a sense of urgency to protect their own assets: jobs, property, and culture. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Completely pulling the UK out of the European Union is the wrong answer, but that doesn't mean the question is wrong. How do we make sure as many people are safe, secure, and healthy as possible? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that should be the role of the government, but I definitely understand that government doesn't always live up to that promise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We talked about all of this, but maybe due to the heat, it being my 3rd red Solo cup of Racer 5 IPA, and having woken up early with two very excited little girls who couldn't stop asking when the parade was going to start, I was not as articulate as I intended to be. When we discussed what the things are that people need most, I had opinions but they didn't come out clearly. I woke up today rehashing parts of that conversation and am writing this now to take a virtual do-over. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a much better articulation of what &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; people want, Republican and Democrat, neo-liberal and neo-nazi. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Life&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone wants the good life, the American dream, a house and a job and savings for retirement all while being able to afford a family vacation every year and meal or two out at a restaurant every week. This is the picture of "middle-class" America: parents with a kid or three, a house in the suburbs, and &lt;em&gt;enough money to be comfortable now and well into the future&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people assume that the middle-class is the bell in the bell curve with a relatively small number of poor at the bottom and rich at the top. It's not. **There's nothing "middle" about the middle-class. **&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are middle-class in California, you're well into the top 10% of earners. There are twice as many households making less than $100K per year as there are making more than $100K. And sadly families with $100K of household income would be considered low income (unable to comfortably afford food, shelter, and fun) in most parts of California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's an interesting exercise. Let's break down the expenses for a family with two kids in the Bay Area on a $200,000 household income. Note that $200K yields about $140K after tax, or $12K per month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monthly expenses for a middle class family of four in the Bay Area:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mortgage + property tax + maintenance on a $1M "starter home": &lt;strong&gt;$5K&lt;/strong&gt;- Childcare (nanny or preschool) for 2 kids: &lt;strong&gt;$3K&lt;/strong&gt;- Loan payments (car, student loans, etc): &lt;strong&gt;$1K&lt;/strong&gt;- Food (groceries and restaurants): &lt;strong&gt;$1K&lt;/strong&gt;- Healthcare (usually taken from paycheck): &lt;strong&gt;$1K&lt;/strong&gt;- Savings or other: &lt;strong&gt;$1K&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a household income of $200,000, which is a princely sum by any stretch, you are just getting by in the Bay Area. Move-in ready homes in desirable neighborhoods with good schools run about $1 million. Everywhere you look, that's the rate. You might find a house with some maintenance requirements that will sell for $800-900K but even that will be competitive. Everyone's looking for deals like that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Childcare is expensive too. I didn't know it when I had kids, but for the first five years of their lives I'd basically be responsible for a second mortgage. Unless you have family or some other resource to help out every day (or a stay-at-home parent) you will need to spend &lt;em&gt;at least&lt;/em&gt; $2,500 per month on childcare. And then there's everything else which just adds up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you're really just getting by at $200K, and by that I mean your boxes are checked but you're without much cushion, imagine what it means to make less than that. Think about the sacrifices you make to live on $100K with a family here in California. Then look at this chart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;!({static}/images/income.png)
&lt;em&gt;Most people don't make enough money to be middle class in California. Source: (https://statisticalatlas.com/state/California/Household-Income#figure/household-income-distribution)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's crazy. About 9 million households in California make less than $100K. About 4 million make more than $100K. And $100K is not even breaking even if you really want to live the middle class American dream. It's not even close. You need to be in the $200K+ bracket, which is only 8.6% of the population. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, the middle and upper classes are less than 10% of Californians. The rest are barely getting by or not getting by at all. This is the reality we face not only here, but elsewhere in the country as well. It's hard to live the life we thought we were promised in grade school, where we were taught to get a job, wake up in the morning and go to work, collect a paycheck and come home to support your family. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was supposed to be achievable simply by going to school and working hard. It wasn't supposed to be a top 10% proposition. It was supposed to be for everybody. It is not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what led to Trump, to Brexit, and to a host of other populist movements (France, Poland, Italy) gripping the world right now. It's not an irrational zeal for border protections and trade barriers. It's perfectly rational. It's just not the right answer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem isn't "them." It's us. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Liberty&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our country was founded to avoid religious persecution (and British taxes) but clearly the principal that our founding fathers cared most about was liberty. Freedom to choose your destiny, where you live and work, who you pray to, and how you raise your family. Government was supposed to be primarily invisible, making things work in the background, appearing only when things needed to be fixed. The rest was to be left up to the people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our two parties today differ on what ought to be regulated. Democrats lean toward regulating businesses (stronger environmental, labor, and safety restrictions) while Republicans lean toward regulating people (stronger marriage, abortion, immigration, religious restrictions). Neither party is completely "liberal" and instead they differ on where exactly free will should be granted. It's fascinating when you dig into it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all agree, however, in freedom of opportunity. I don't know a single Republican or Democrat who doesn't believe that someone should be able to work hard, take some risks, and be rewarded if it works out. That's the common American ideal, shared by everyone, across party and racial lines. It's very American, but I think it transcends countries too. Everyone loves the entrepreneurial success story. Every country and culture celebrates its business titans. When fame and fortune come from movies or sports, all the better. We all love our heroes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liberty ultimately means the freedom to set your success. If you want to pull in a blue collar paycheck for forty years and retire with a pension to Florida, go for it, it's yours. If you want to drill for oil and strike it rich and get a library named after you then by all means. Give it a go. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eat as much or as little of the American pie as you want. That's liberty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is when other interests get in the way of that freedom. The destruction of liberties can be slow and silent. When our government prioritizes the health of businesses over the health of workers, when budgets and tax cuts are set to favor one class or one party over another, our collective ability to make an American living deteriorates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what I believe people have been feeling for the last several years. Instead of lashing out against our elected officials and pushing for policies that prop up the middle-class, we elected someone (Donald Trump) who spoke to middle-class ailments but successfully framed them as coming from external sources. It's Mexico, it's Islam, it's China, it's everything and everyone attacking our liberties except us. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I couldn't disagree more, but nonetheless that's the state of things today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pursuit of Happiness&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you do with this American dream? Well, you feel happy. As you should, because you're lucky to be here. When you have the freedom to either make more money or less money, you're happy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happiness comes in many forms, of course, and not everyone needs the yacht and private jet to be perfectly 100% content with their lot. Merely being able to make your own decisions that impact your own outcome is sufficient to bring happiness. It's knowing that you did it your way. And if you don't like it anymore, it's knowing that you can change your course and fix it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When any of these elements are taken away or appear to unattainable, the entire system falters. That's what happened in the US and UK in 2016, first with the UK's vote to leave the EU and then the US vote to elect Donald Trump. It happened because people lost faith in their ability to reach their goals. They felt suppressed, anxious, untrusting of the existing norms that once yielded happiness but appeared to no longer do so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agreed with my neighbor that the populist reaction is wrong, short sighted, and erroneous in thinking that we'll find strength in cutting off the rest of the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't have the answer right now, but I know that blaming everyone else is not the right answer. We have to solve it by looking at the world and making ourselves better. There's plenty of opportunity, and a lot of it can be taken while actually improving the outlook for ourselves and the rest of the creatures we share this planet with. I'll dive into this in a future post.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category><category term="personal"></category><category term="reflection"></category><category term="philosophy"></category><category term="life-lessons"></category><category term="goals"></category></entry><entry><title>On nine whole years of marriage</title><link href="https://rbucks.com/2019/06/12/on-nine-whole-years-of-marriage/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-06-12T22:16:00-07:00</published><updated>2019-06-12T22:16:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Ryan Buckley</name></author><id>tag:rbucks.com,2019-06-12:/2019/06/12/on-nine-whole-years-of-marriage/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;*Note: my wife did not know I was going to write and publish this. *&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a lucky man. I think most people in my neighborhood would recognize this. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My wife is friendly, attractive, likes to cook and do laundry, is a wonderful mom to my daughters... and works! She makes a lot of money. If we were really keeping score (and we're not), I'd have her beat by a little bit, but we're basically even contributors to the family budget's bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, she loves me. I've never doubted it, never felt otherwise, never needed to question, and I realize that I probably take this entirely for granted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like I said, I am a lucky man. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I forgive myself for that oversight, as most men tend to do, because I think I'm a pretty good husband. If I may say so myself. I cook, I clean, I wash dishes and put them away, I do laundry (when she lets me) and I take the kids to school 99.9% of the time (she picks them up). Until just recently I was home every day because I worked from home (I'll describe my first temporary office in Walnut Creek for summer interns in (https://rbucks.com/2019/08/07/back-to-the-office-and-back-again/)). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From what I can tell, the things most married couples argue over relate to conflicts between work and family time. I'm no saint, but I think I do a pretty good job of managing that balance. Even with my new office situation, I'm home by 5:30pm and I still take the kids to school. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the improvement side, I work (or at least am on my computer) more than half the evenings in a given week, including weekends. Despite (https://rbucks.com/2017/04/28/three-life-hacks-i-wish-i-did-more-often/) it, I'm definitely on my phone too much. I could be more proactive about planning meals, family activities, and time alone with just my wife. I'm aware, and writing this down helps me remind myself that it's important to translate awareness into action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, okay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nine years is a long time. A damn long time. If I think about how much happened between when I was born and my ninth birthday, I think wow, that's a lot. Infant to fourth grade. Twice my older daughter's age. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a long time, and yet it has flown by. How can it be? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer, I believe, is the same one that I described in my wedding toast nine years ago tonight. In it, I described how I was nervous about getting married. There's a lot of divorce in my family, including my own parents. When I was dating my wife-to-be, I wasn't sure what to make of that. I definitely didn't want to get divorced, but it seemed the odds were against me. I decided to get married anyway because it felt so &lt;em&gt;easy.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, everything about our relationship was easy. We just got along. We didn't argue, we didn't suppress feelings. When we had feelings, we shared them. I remember a few times when I felt that she was upset but not telling me, and called her out on it. She relented and we worked through the issues without either of us getting too upset. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've cried, she's cried, we've cried together at one time or another in these nine years. Looking back on those times now, I don't have bad feelings. Those were part of our evolution as a couple. Those were real moments when we both learned what the other needed to feel happy, safe, protected, and loved. Those were critical moments that actually strengthened our relationship, like building a muscle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So since she and I have been on a exercise kick the last few months, that's the thought that I will end with. Nine years of marriage is certainly a workout, but the result is strength. Every passing year I feel a tighter, stronger bond with the woman I have married. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a lucky man. And she is lucky too :)&lt;/p&gt;

There used to be a lot more flights out of OAK a decade ago when I did this trip several times a year. Now they are few and far between. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time I have a house and a family to miss and a dog to get cared for while I'm gone. The last time I was here for a class reunion was five years ago. I was almost a dad then, but not quite. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of this stretch between Harvard and MIT has remained the same. And the weather in Boston right now is perfect, just barely humid, a nice cool breeze in the shade. I forgot my sweater and am happy to not miss it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I received my acceptance email from the admissions office at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government  on March 4, 2006, just over 13 years ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was obviously a big deal for me and my parents. I'd be the first in my family to attend a school like Harvard and for my mom it was a dream come true. She'd encouraged me to apply to Harvard when I was in high school. I did and got waitlisted, but in my heart of hearts I wanted to go to (https://nature.berkeley.edu/). I told Harvard College to bugger off, and I made a mental note to do everything I could to build a competitive application for a Harvard grad school program instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The path from August 2000, when I matriculated to Cal, to February 2006, when I submitted my Harvard Kennedy School admission application for the Master in Public Policy program, was a long one. I worked hard at UC Berkeley, both in and out of the classroom, to differentiate myself. My grades were good but not among the best. I knew I'd need something special to catch the eye of admissions officers at Harvard, so I focused on environmental activities and leadership in those circles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The capstone of my admission packet was probably the letter of recommendation from Chancellor Berdahl. I never read it, but I'm pretty sure it was good. He and I had a lot of mutual respect and I was able to capitalize on it to move my sustainability agenda forward. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of note, it wasn't Chancellor Berdahl who I worked with to get that letter drafted and delivered. It was one of his staff, a guy named Sean Ireland, who probably wrote the letter and got the Chancellor to sign it. He was my man on the inside and nothing would have happened without him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've learned time and time again that you have to be nice to and appreciative of everyone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;!({static}/images/berdahl-award_orig.jpg?w=1024)
&lt;em&gt;The Chancellor of UC Berkeley giving me one of the first Berkeley Sustainability Awards.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I was good at this campus sustainability politicking and probably the best at doing this at UC Berkeley at the time. My skills met the right opportunity and it catapulted me forward. I made sure that my Harvard grad school application emphasized that point. I got in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I forwarded that fateful email from Harvard to my mom and went to the bar at a nice restaurant downstairs from the office tower I worked at in San Francisco to celebrate. It was five in the afternoon and I decided to splurge on a shot of Johnny Walker Blue on the rocks. My mom called while it was being prepared. She'd been crying. When the bartender overheard what I was celebrating (not too many 24-year-olds order a $60 shot at five in the afternoon, even in San Francisco), she told me it was on the house. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was on cloud nine. I soon made plans to quit my job, spend the summer on an epic road trip through the southwest to Colorado and then to Spain and Europe. It was a unique and amazing time in my life. Limitless opportunity, no obligations, and most of all, a sense of pride that I'd worked towards an ambitious goal and achieved it. It was done. Nobody could take it away. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;!({static}/images/img_0108.jpg)- !({static}/images/img_0182.jpg)- !({static}/images/img_0275.jpg)- !({static}/images/img_0353.jpg)- !({static}/images/img_0438.jpg)- !({static}/images/img_0473.jpg)- !({static}/images/img_0624.jpg)- !({static}/images/img_0649.jpg)- !({static}/images/img_0699.jpg)- !({static}/images/img_0788.jpg)- !({static}/images/img_0972.jpg)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the rest of my life I'd always have that Harvard acceptance letter. I was in the club. Indeed my life would change forever, but not in the ways I originally expected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was through the Kennedy School that I (https://rbucks.com/2019/06/12/on-nine-whole-years-of-marriage/): Chancellor Berdahl introduced me to the Lieutenant Governor of California, John Garamendi. He offered me a summer internship writing environmental policy papers. His wife Patti gave me a ticket to the event where I met Melissa. We would eventually get married and start a family, raising my (https://rbucks.com/2018/06/27/benefits-of-being-a-work-from-home-dad/). This is easily the biggest, most important thing I've ever done. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought the Kennedy School would set me on a path into government, but instead I caught the (https://rbucks.com/2016/05/20/the-scripted-origin-story-as-i-remember-it/). I applied to and got accepted to the MBA program at the MIT Sloan School of Management. The registrars at Harvard and MIT allowed me and three other students to get two Master's degrees in three years. The company I'd go on to co-found with Sunil Rajaraman was a ten-year odyssey through the (https://rbucks.com/2019/02/01/the-bitter-taste-of-failure/) of startup culture in Silicon Valley. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My career to date stems entirely from this startup rather than from my graduate school degrees. I can't say that I regret it. The startup experience I've gained allowed me to (https://rbucks.com/2016/03/22/an-ode-to-the-suburbs/) and raise two kids in the Bay Area. I have tons of flexibility to explore my community and work on a lot of (https://rbucks.com/2018/07/02/my-first-commission-seat-in-contra-costa-county/). I had no idea 13 years ago that this is what I would be doing now, that I'd skip my 10-year Kennedy School reunion in favor of my MIT Sloan reunion, where the cover band I played in would headline the main happy hour party for my entire class. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But such is life. It's unpredictable. At 36, going on 37, I'm still young. I feel young too, physically in better shape than I was when I was a student. I'm definitely stronger. I can do way more pullups now than I could at 24. Jogging up hills pushing a double stroller has done wonders for my fitness, so I'm probably thinner although my weight is more or less the same. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I'm taking my time here in Boston this weekend to soak it all in. The Charles River is beautiful, the brick sidewalks and lush vegetation as alluring as it was the first time I stepped foot in Cambridge. This place has the same magnetism that it had for me back then, and it gives me the same curiosity about my place in the world, the potential I still have in front of me. I can't help getting excited about (https://rbucks.com/2017/07/11/whats-next-for-me/).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Read: 3 books on Finance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This quarter I managed to read three books as part of my self-improvement curriculum. In (https://rbucks.com/2019/02/06/my-personal-2018-recap/), I mentioned how I wanted to focus my media consumption on specific topics. Rather than trying to read and keep up on everything, I'd put blinders up and focus on one (fairly broad) topic. I decided to make finance and accounting the inaugural subject matter, and I initially set out to read two books. However long it took to read two books on finance would be the length of my "class." I ended up reading three. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;(https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0018QQQKS) by Nial Ferguson&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An awesome overview of the financial history of the world. I listened to the audiobook many years ago and told myself then that this book deserved a second pass. It's so dense, so fascinating, so comprehensive that it warrants real study. I tried to read this book slowly and let it sink in, but giving it the treatment it deserved probably would have meant taking months to read it rather than weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made 16 Kindle highlight notes in this book, which is a lot for me. Ferguson goes deep into economic theory, noting the structures that make economies actually work. Here are some examples I highlighted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Poor countries are poor, in other words, because they lack secure property rights, the ‘hidden architecture’ of a successful economy." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Nial Ferguson
&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He writes a lot about the role that government plays in laying the groundwork for successful economies. It makes a lot of sense. Government policies can also ruin an economy, as in the example of hyperinflation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Inflation is a monetary phenomenon, as Milton Friedman said. But hyperinflation is always and everywhere a political phenomenon, in the sense that it cannot occur without a fundamental malfunction of a country’s political economy."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Nial Ferguson&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also explains how government policies in the future can improve the gap between rich and poor. I've often wondered why poverty has existed throughout history. I've not heard of a society in all of modern humanity, going back to the advent of cities, where there wasn't an upper class and a lower class. Prior to the birth of cities, I think there was a forced egalitarianism. I think (and I admit to needing to study this) that Native American societies didn't have the concept of rich and poor. One's hierarchical ascent in their society came only with age. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Only when borrowers have access to efficient credit networks can they escape from the clutches of loan sharks, and only when savers can deposit their money in reliable banks can it be channelled from the idle rich to the industrious poor."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Nial Ferguson&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course this purely free market solution could certainly be argued against. Ferguson addresses externalities throughout the book but clearly has a firm belief that when an economic structure exists with clear rules that allows the free economic transfer of goods and services, people will prosper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is a great read for anyone studying economics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;(https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18966580-financial-intelligence-revised-edition) by Karen Berman and Joe Knight&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the perfect book for what I was looking for: a simple review of financial statements and the common ratios to analyze them. It is well-written, informative, and just the right length. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, unlike The Ascent of Money, I didn't make a single highlight. It's not a reflection on the quality of the book at all. It's just not the kind of read that makes you want to highlight. It is, however, exactly as advertised. I do have a better understanding of the art behind finance. I'm more financially intelligent. I know now where the subjectivity lies in the income statement, around how revenue and depreciation can be impacted simply by what rule the controller chooses to recognize them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also now have greater appreciation for Warren Buffet's view on financial statements. He puts the greatest weight on the Statement of Cash Flows, because for the most part, this statement can't be influenced by the whims of the people running the books. There are ratios, which I recall from my MBA classes but didn't really click until I read about them in this context, that compare numbers from Statement of Cash Flows with the Income Statement or Balance Sheet. Those seem like the best way to evaluate a business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm very glad I read this one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;(https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/70420.The_Undercover_Economist) by Tim Harford&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Undercover Economist came up in some podcasts and Google searches. I liked Freakonomics and decided that this would be a good book to read to start my finance "course." It turned out to be my least favorite of the three books I read, but it's not necessarily because it's a bad book. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harford writes about how both positive and negative externalities can be unexpected and some surprising factors that influence pricing. He also makes a case for expanded health care, something similar to "Medicare for all," saying this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The best  system would be one that compels patients to pay for many of the costs, thus providing an incentive to inform themselves and to make choices that are both in their interests and reasonably cost-effective, but which leaves the most severe costs to the government or insurance."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Tim Harford&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also thought his arguments in favor of free trade were compelling. He explains why presidents are in favor of free trade (it's good for the nation as a whole, even if some specific communities are impacted negatively), and explains why global free trade ought to save the environment and decrease poverty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, as is the case with Financial Intelligence, financial statements and global markets don't work perfectly because whims and emotions get in the way. As Hartford writes, "In the end, economics is about people." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would add, "and people aren't perfect."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus my financial class is complete. I subscribed to the Wall Street Journal and started reading it every day, watched some financial documentaries, read some other articles on finance, and finished these books. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This quarter I am going to read 3 books about design and do something I've been wanting to do for decades. I've started to learn how to draw. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Write: Cancer stuff&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a book in mind that I intend to write, but I haven't started writing it yet. There's an outline but that's it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, my writing in Q1 was dominated mostly by some good and bad news I got regarding my papillary thyroid cancer. I think it's summarized pretty well in my most (https://rbucks.com/2019/04/27/and-now-a-bit-of-certainty/). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The news is mostly good, and I am mostly fine. Writing about it is therapeutic and sharing it kind of sets it off to sea. I share because if I write and don't share then I feel like it's still stuck with me. By publishing it, I can push it into the world and out of my head, away from my psyche. So that's why I write and publish these stories. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Play: The Rolling Sloans&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been playing a lot of guitar and piano and I've started taking singing lessons too. I found a (http://erinsvoiceandpiano.com) who I pay a little bit extra for the convenience of her coming to my house for our lessons. She coaches me through beginner to intermediate-ish pieces by Mozart, Beethoven, and Bach. She gives me scale exercises and guidance on how to make sure my fingering is correct when the sheet music isn't explicit. I've become a much better piano player since the lessons began and it's become more and more fun to play piano. It really started to click for me in the last few months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, I've been preparing for the 10 year reunion of my grad school band, The Rolling Sloans. We're playing in Boston on Saturday night, June 8, and I've been preparing for this for months. I have a Spotify playlist of our set, printouts of the music, and have been playing along with the songs as frequently as I can. When my girls are playing in the court with my neighbors, I fire up Spotify, grab my acoustic guitar, and jam along with the tracks. It's the best way I can think of to practice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;!({static}/images/screen-shot-2019-04-28-at-2.45.31-pm.png)
&lt;em&gt;First half&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;!({static}/images/screen-shot-2019-04-28-at-2.45.12-pm.png)
&lt;em&gt;Second half&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm going to sing a few, just like I did for our 3-hour set five years ago. This time we'll have between 1.5-2 hours to play and we're going to jam in as much music as possible. The songs I'm leading for are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alone - Heart- My Hero - Foo Fighters- Mayonaise - Smashing Pumpkins- Love Yourself - Justin Bieber- Shine - Collective Soul&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been working on these with my teacher, who in the course of the last few months has increased my upper range by a minor third (three half-steps). More importantly, I'm more confident, more comfortable, and more excited to sing in front of my classmates than ever. I was nervous five years ago, and spent most of my prep time working on guitar solos. I didn't practice singing. When I was an MBA student, I definitely didn't practice singing. There was no time. I played lead guitar and let our rhythm guitar player and singer do all the vocals. We had a blast playing more shows than I can count. We were in demand because we were really good. Like &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; good. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten years later I want to present myself a bit more polished and matured as a musician. I will have more fun on stage if I'm confident, and I will be more confident if I'm comfortable with how I'm playing and sounding. So I've basically been playing my solo songs non-stop, in front of family and neighbors and of course my piano and voice teacher. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My next RWP will feature highlights from the show! Can't wait.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category><category term="reading"></category><category term="writing"></category><category term="music"></category><category term="self-improvement"></category><category term="finance"></category></entry><entry><title>And now, a bit of certainty</title><link href="https://rbucks.com/2019/04/27/and-now-a-bit-of-certainty/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-04-27T21:33:00-07:00</published><updated>2019-04-27T21:33:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Ryan Buckley</name></author><id>tag:rbucks.com,2019-04-27:/2019/04/27/and-now-a-bit-of-certainty/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you're new to my cancer saga, here are parts (https://rbucks.com/2017/06/24/my-thyroid-got-cancer/) and (https://rbucks.com/2018/02/22/my-thyroid-got-cancer-one-year-later/).

Part three is coming along in a couple of sittings like (https://rbucks.com/2019/02/13/the-thing-that-wont-go-away/) (https://rbucks.com/2019/03/22/here-i-go-again/). It's the part where after I get diagnosed with papillary thyroid cancer, get it removed, and carry on with a bit of cloud hanging over my head, the cloud comes into focus. Now I know what's next. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you hadn't heard, cancer sucks. If it doesn't kill your body, it tries to kill your spirit, your innocence, your optimism that you can fight and handle anything if you just eat healthy, work out, and be nice to people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, cancer doesn't give a fucking shit about any of it. I could be a paleo-keto-vegan monk teaching orphans how to meditate. I'd still have this fucking cancer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the last two years, my biggest concern about my experience with cancer was not my missing thyroid or the pills I have to take, it was the uncertainty that it might still be there, lurking in the shadows of my neck. My blood tests didn't &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; pass muster. My ultrasounds and MRIs were not &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; pristine. Something was afoot, and the evidence kept pointing back to this one rogue lymph node. An asymmetric blob that my docs at Kaiser found and my docs at John Muir Medical Center finally biopsied. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's where I left off last time. The follow-up involved an MRI to thoroughly case my neck, explicitly looking for more funny business. Neck MRI scans, because this area of the body is so complex, take a while. The technician told me that these are the longest scans they do. For forty-five minutes I'm squished in a tube, unable to move my upper body, with earplugs in my ears to muddle out the crazy thumping and bumping sounds that the MRI machine makes. It's the worst. I'm grateful for the technology. I'm glad that I have insurance and can afford the copay. But boy do I wish I didn't have to get MRIs of my neck. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been coupling these cancer hospital appointments with swim workouts. The motion of my body and the sound of the water feels cleansing, like a baptism. Hospitals, for all of their sterility, feel dirty to me. It's like I need to wash the hospital air right off of me. Hospitals are for sick people. I'm not sick. At least I don't feel like it, don't think it, don't act like it. And technically I'm not sick, even though at this very moment I have papillary thyroid cancer in a lymph node near my clavicle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've made the mistake of reading through the (https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/). It is not a place for the faint of heart. These are real tragedies. My saga is a fairy tale compared to many people writing on that forum. I can't complain, but I do because it's only natural to gripe when something's not fair, even when other innocent people have it worse. Far worse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was on Reddit that I learned a new word, "scanxiety." It's the fear of finding out your test results, the moment when your doctor's number shows up on your phone and you realize that in mere seconds you will find out if the news you've been waiting for is good or bad. Did the numbers go up or down? Is it better or worse? Am I going to live a long life or die next month? After every scan there's more scanxiety waiting for you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was how I felt after the MRI. After the biopsy I was fully prepared for the bad news. It was pretty obvious that Dr. B thought they'd find cancer. What she didn't know is if, given that biopsy, there would be evidence of other cancers in my neck. It's not unusual in papillary thyroid cancer for it to spread in the local lymph nodes. However, for this particular cancer, even with the spread it is technically a Stage 1 cancer. Meaning, even without this positive biopsy, I'd be a Stage 1 papillary thyroid cancer patient. Having the one positive lymph node doesn't change the stage. To be Stage 2 they'd have to find it beyond the lymph nodes in my neck. It was possible the MRI could show this. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So yes indeed, I had scanxiety when the report came back, first via email, and then via a phone call from Dr. B's office. I remember I got the email when I was putting my younger daughter to bed. When she's drifting off, I rub her back with one hand and play chess or crossword puzzles on my phone with my other. The email alert popped up and I saw it was a test result from John Muir Hospital. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suddenly I have two hands on the phone. My breathing is a bit shorter. My lips tense and contract. I try to calm myself as I open the message, click on the link, and log in. I wait for the screen to load, click on the test, and read the results. I scan for the punchline and find it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No more bad news. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes! Finally, some certainty. My bad news stops with one lymph node, and that can be dealt with using a little bit of radioactive iodine. In my position this is as good as it gets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now I'm waiting for my insurance and the pharmacy to do their dance and tell me how much more savings I have to put into my treatment. For the first time in my life, I will probably hit my out-of-pocket maximum. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm grateful for insurance, and also that I can afford it, but man oh man. If cancer wasn't scary enough, the cancer treatment bills make it even scarier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life goes on though. You make money, you spend it. We'll see what happens next.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category><category term="cancer"></category><category term="thyroid-cancer"></category><category term="health"></category><category term="personal"></category><category term="reflection"></category></entry><entry><title>The game I'm playing</title><link href="https://rbucks.com/2019/04/26/the-game-im-playing/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-04-26T21:11:00-07:00</published><updated>2019-04-26T21:11:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Ryan Buckley</name></author><id>tag:rbucks.com,2019-04-26:/2019/04/26/the-game-im-playing/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Here's more mid-30s introspection about life and goals. These are things I've been thinking about as the people around me and I get older. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What game am I playing? How do I know if I'm winning or at least doing above average?  And why, for goodness sake, does this even …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Here's more mid-30s introspection about life and goals. These are things I've been thinking about as the people around me and I get older. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What game am I playing? How do I know if I'm winning or at least doing above average?  And why, for goodness sake, does this even matter?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like most people with a pulse, I have pride and ego. It would be really nice if I honestly truly didn't care about how successful my friends, neighbors, and schoolmates are, that I don't notice when someone I know buys a Porsche or a Tesla or is an early employee (or founder) of a publicly traded company. I do notice, I do think about it, I do introspect for a moment, sometimes longer, and ask myself if I'm still doing it right. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer, I've decided, depends on what game I'm playing. Is it the make as much money as possible game? Have the biggest house and fanciest car game? Is it the have the most social impact game? Travel to the most places game? Have the most fun game? All of these are interesting, valid ways to live a life. But am I playing them? Am I even on the field? If not, what am I doing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am writing this post to help myself figure out this fairly existential problem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Game #1: Make the most money. (Answer: No.)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd love to have $20M in my bank account. I would not love what it (most likely) takes to get that $20M. Here are a few scenarios. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Be a founder of a public company.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Too much work. I looked into this, tried it on for size, worked really hard for about five years, and came up short. Sadly, the window I had to start a company that might go public (https://rbucks.com/2019/02/01/im-not-fundable/) on my poor little fingers. We raised $16M and did all the things that venture-backed companies in early stages do to try to make it, (https://rbucks.com/2017/07/12/scripted-dont-quit/).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've seen other friends have much more success, and while I tip my hat to each and every one of them, I also recognize the sacrifices they made to get there. It's a lot of work, stress, and time. This is a lifestyle I don't want right now. It's not my game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Be a partner or senior executive at a large company.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don't need to start a company to get rich, of course. Managing directors and C-level executives at top consulting and other private sector firms can make north of $1M per year in salary and bonuses. In fact, this is how a majority of millionaires make their millions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's also a lifestyle where you go to the office every day, work late, wake up early, and probably travel an awful lot. I caught a glimpse of this during my two years of management consulting after college. I decided this was not for me. So I went to grad school and did my startups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've concluded that I'm not great at making gobs of money. I'm good at making enough money to be comfortable in the Bay Area, which is a feat itself, but beyond a certain point, I get complacent. The itch to earn more fades away pretty fast. Like I said, not my game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Game #2: Have the most expensive things. (Answer: No.)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don't need to make tons of money to have a lot of nice things. If you maximize for consumption, then you need merely to minimize your other expenses. For example, if I really wanted to have a bunch of nice things, like fancy cars, income properties, and jewelry, I would not have had kids. Having kids is the worst way to go about having expensive things, and yet I had two of them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, this is not my game either, and if you know me then this should come as no surprise. I like comforts. I like nice cigars, scotches, and hotels, but I'd rather ride my bike or jog than drive my Camry or my Hyundai. I have a Rolex but it was a gift from my parents. Our house is expensive but it's below average for the Bay Area. The expensive things I own are not out of some flamboyant need for show or due to personal preference. They're expensive because they have to be expensive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish I didn't have to spend $24,000 on a car for my family, but I did the research and bought a nice, safe, &lt;em&gt;used&lt;/em&gt; car.  Same with the patio we put on the side of the house and the deck we added soon after we purchased. Those are necessities, and since we plan to live here forever, it felt like good investments to choose the nicer options of those projects. I want to be able to make decisions like that. Get the more expensive, higher quality housing materials. Do some upgrades! We can afford it because we've opted out of the most expensive options elsewhere in our spending. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So no, I don't want to have the most expensive things. I don't want the biggest house or the best car. In fact, I never did. I just want to be comfortable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Game #3: Have the most impact. (Answer: Maybe.)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At one point in my life, this was definitely a goal. I really wanted to dedicate myself to environmental sustainability. I was going to be an activist, a networker, mover-and-shaker, someone who could influence policy at the highest levels. This was the person I was in high school and college. It's the person who spoke at his college graduation, got some University-wide and national awards, and ultimately got accepted to the (https://rbucks.com/2019/06/06/what-my-grad-school-experience-meant-to-me/). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That guy is still here, but he's... chillin'. He got older, fell in love, started a family, and fell into the world of technology and startups and the fascinating leadership, management, and other intellectual challenges surrounding them. This is where I'm at now. I'm immersed in the challenge of building and running startups. It checks all of my boxes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interesting work - Interesting people- Good salary with great upside- Autonomy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like to build things. I like to run them too. It's a lot easier to build and run a technology company than an environmental non-profit. I like to have customers. The flow of money is a simple way to measure the value of what I'm building. Even when I know it's not necessarily making the world better, I know that I'm at least making &lt;em&gt;someone's&lt;/em&gt; life better. They wouldn't be paying for my product otherwise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That simple little thing, knowing that I built or am running something valuable enough to make hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars (haven't reached that "tens of millions" stage yet) , is enough to get me by. I'm content, but I do wish that I could add this bullet to the list I wrote above:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Makes a meaningful positive impact on the world&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scripted had elements of this. We helped people with writing talents make ends meet. Moms bought groceries with the money we helped them earn. Dads bought Christmas presents they would not have otherwise afforded. These are real stories we heard and that felt legitimately good. Nothing I've built since has had impact anywhere close.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So yes, this is a game I want to play. I'm not playing it now, but it's a field I want to be on. Someday I will make it happen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Game #4: Travel, be independent, have fun. (Answer: No.)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The single bachelors I know are not the most happy people I know. They struggle like everyone else to figure out the game that they're playing too. Even though these are the guys that have the freedom, financially and otherwise, to travel anywhere, attend any event, and date anyone. I have seen that this is not the key to happiness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happiness takes time to enroot. During that time, I believe, you have to be relatively still. You can't keep moving all the time, forming new relationships with people and places. You need to settle down long enough for the happiness to grow, and the longer you stay still, the deeper those roots grow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm three years into my (https://rbucks.com/2016/03/22/an-ode-to-the-suburbs/) and still can't believe my luck. We have incredible neighbors. A wonderful community of like-minded people who are friendly and interesting and easy to talk to. I've happened upon a group of dads in my neighborhood whom I'll host (https://rbucks.com/2017/08/27/the-view-from-35/) and see much more frequently out on the street. This is a neighborhood where people run into each other in front of their houses &lt;em&gt;all the time&lt;/em&gt;. It's amazing. And these relationships take time to develop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've found that it takes several random meetings like this to make a new friend. The first time I see a new face in the neighborhood, I'm pretty quick to say hi. We exchange the normal pleasantries and pretty quickly move along. I'm usually walking or jogging my kids when this happens. The next time, the conversation lasts longer. If they have a kid, then our kids will play. I learn more about them, more connections are made. The third time I see them, we're basically friends. There's familiarity and a genuine interest in catching up on the last conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing is, this sequence of three meetings takes time. In most cases, it takes several months. If this is a dad who happens to, like me, be out in the hood chasing a kid nearly every day, then it can happen faster. Most of the time it's slow. And this is what I mean about happiness taking time to enroot. Happiness is really about community. The people with a strong community are the happiest. That community can be family, church, neighbors, coworkers, but it's a community. You can't build a community when you're moving all the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So although I do sometimes wish I could be 23 backpacking through Europe again, I recognize that that was then and this is now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was pretty happy then. I'm even happier now. I choose these roots over that freedom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Game #5: Comfort and flexibility. (Answer: Yes.)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I rigged it. Is this a game? I don't know. I guess so. I've certainly optimized for it, so it must be something, but I picked this game because I'm doing very well at it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm comfortable. I have a mortgage and two kids in pre-school in the California Bay Area and I can shop at Whole Foods, eat out at restaurants, and still save for the future. This is a huge accomplishment by any measure. Add on top of that the fact that I can work from home whenever I want, have a job that I actually enjoy, and get to choose when I work and who I work with, and yes, I'm crushing the game. I'm like 12 under par at the Master's. I'm the Tiger Woods of finding comfort and flexibility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also appreciate that I worked hard to get this. This lifestyle wasn't handed to me, and it was never a given that I'd get it. I set myself up for this, took some risks, and I'm enjoying the rewards. I should allow myself to be proud of the fact that the game I ended  up playing is the one I'm most equipped to win. Maybe I've already won it. It's been over two years since I've had to be in an office every day. I don't think I'm ever going back. If I have an office again it'll be the office I use when I'm in the office, not the office I'm expected in every day. That's just not how I roll. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;So now what?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've just determined that I'm winning at something. I have a game, comfort and flexibility, and I'm on top of it. So now what? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the answer is pretty clear. I want to keep the baseline the same and add two more elements, in this order:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make a larger social impact- Earn more money&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two could go hand-in-hand. I've often thought that I would be a very good millionnaire. When I think about having tons of disposable income, I don't think about private jets and oil paintings. I think about writing a huge check to UC Berkeley. I think about hearing about or witnessing a tragedy in my community and having the means to address it. I would love nothing more than to find out a community organization that does important work is shy $25,000 of their financing goal and tap the director on the shoulder and tell them I have it covered. That's what I would do if I had the money. I'd totally be that guy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that windfall would come only because I set myself up for luck and I got lucky. I'm not going to earn that kind of money by force of sheer will. It's not my game. So if I don't make millions on a windfall, I'll have to make an impact in other ways. Maybe I'll come up with an amazing idea for a product that people or businesses will pay for that actually makes the world a better place. Maybe I'll invent a better compost bin, a new way to (https://rbucks.com/2019/05/24/what-im-most-afraid-of/), a website that somehow reduces global warming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I had that idea, I'd be building it right now. Alas, I don't. So I will keep playing the game I'm playing until the game I want to play comes into view: Comfort, flexibility, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; impact. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, that's the game I want to play. It's just a matter of time.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category><category term="personal"></category><category term="goals"></category><category term="reflection"></category><category term="entrepreneurship"></category><category term="ambition"></category></entry><entry><title>Being the other co-founder</title><link href="https://rbucks.com/2019/03/22/being-the-other-co-founder/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-03-22T21:01:00-07:00</published><updated>2019-03-22T21:01:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Ryan Buckley</name></author><id>tag:rbucks.com,2019-03-22:/2019/03/22/being-the-other-co-founder/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Reflecting back on Scripted, I think it stopped feeling like my own company pretty early on.

I had the luster of a co-founder title but I really was an employee like everyone else. There were some extra freedoms, perhaps, but not real freedom. Not like I have it now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of it was not being CEO until the end. Being the second, internal, “other” founder of a company has its drawbacks. I didn’t have direct contact with the board. In the early days of Scripted, outside of board meetings, all contact went through my co-founder, who was CEO. This meant my co-founder knew everything and I only knew what he told me. Being a co-founder is not the same as being the CEO. Not even close.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm coming up on two full years since my Scripted days came to a close. Since then I've run my own ship, sold that ship, and become a hired CEO. I haven't had a co-founder since Scripted and that distance and my most recent CEO experience has brought with it some new insights about those old days at Scripted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;!({static}/images/munger.jpg)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The co-founder or CEO / non-CEO-but-still-important pairing has many obvious examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak- Warren Buffet and Charlie Munger- Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg- Bill Hewlett and David Packard&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that's just some big names in tech and finance. There's a reason we like to have Presidents and Vice Presidents, Governors and Lieutenant Governors. Most leaders need a competent partner to achieve their greatest potential. Even the most competent CEO can't do it all. He or she needs a confidant, a second opinion, a voice to call out when they make a mistake. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's that last piece about trusting the second partner's opinion and hearing their voice that is most critical. The CEO can always overrule. That's the CEO's job. But if they don't listen, don't want to hear it, and consistently see things differently, then the partnership breaks down. It's inevitable, and history is littered with examples of partnership breakups too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Et tu, Brute?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when I look back and reflect on the glory and the garbage, I think about what I could have done better as the other co-founder, when I wasn't CEO, and also what I could have done better once the mantle was passed to me. Did I speak up enough? Too much? Did I advocate for my CEO, try to make him better and successful? When it was my turn, did I listen and really absorb the opinions around me? Or did I listen too much?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm sure the answer is: &lt;em&gt;all of the above&lt;/em&gt;. Had I played my cards perfectly, Scripted would have had a better outcome. But one thing I've learned from reading Warren Buffet's shareholder letters is when you have a business with even mediocre leadership but in a great, growing market, you can get away with making mistakes. You can make more than a few. At Scripted we made some mistakes, and unfortunately we were not forgiven. It was and still is a very tough market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, I feel for the co-founder COO's of the world. It's a tough, nearly impossible position to be in. Charlie Munger, Sheryl Sandberg, my hat is off to you. You haven't made it look easy, but you've definitely made it look possible.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category><category term="entrepreneurship"></category><category term="scripted"></category><category term="leadership"></category><category term="startups"></category><category term="reflection"></category></entry><entry><title>I don't use shampoo</title><link href="https://rbucks.com/2019/03/03/i-dont-use-shampoo/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-03-03T22:00:00-08:00</published><updated>2019-03-03T22:00:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Ryan Buckley</name></author><id>tag:rbucks.com,2019-03-03:/2019/03/03/i-dont-use-shampoo/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Many years ago, I stopped putting weird liquid soap in my hair every time I showered.

The decision point happened amidst a profound and literal "shower thought." I picked up a bottle of shampoo, looked at it, and thought, “Why am I doing this, again?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then I stopped doing it. That was a long time ago and I've never looked back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I do shower regularly. If I didn’t, I’d start to stink pretty fast. I like a good shower and I always use bar soap. I don’t put that habit in the same category as shampooing every day, which I deem entirely unnecessary. I also do occasionally shampoo my hair with actual shampoo, bar soap, or body wash if it's handy and I think my hair needs it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But honestly, what makes everyone think hair should be washed with soap every day? And when that shampoo dries out your scalp and hair, what do we do? We put this weird lubricant "conditioner" in it. We're replacing the natural oil we washed out of our hair with fake manufactured stuff. The instructions tell us to swap our natural hair oils for fake hair oils every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why? Well, that answer is obvious. These shampoo companies need to grow! They use every social selling trick in the book:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Urgency&lt;/strong&gt;: Do this every day, even twice a day, for best results. - &lt;strong&gt;Social proof&lt;/strong&gt;: Everyone else is doing it. Don't be the weirdo who doesn't shampoo (me!)- &lt;strong&gt;Escalation of commitment&lt;/strong&gt;: Start with our shampoo, graduate to our conditioner. Start with once a day, expand to twice per day. - &lt;strong&gt;Benefits&lt;/strong&gt;: Fuller, silkier, shinier hair. (Same as it would be if you just thoroughly rinsed with water.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've decided to do some research and look into what exactly &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; shampoo. And while I'm at it, what the heck is soap?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is soap?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remembered learning about phospholipids in high school chemistry. It stuck with me because it was a real-world application of science. These molecules are polar: one end  is hyprophilic (attracted to water molecules) and the other is hydrophobic (not so much). This is important because the polar ends of the soap molecule allow it to dissolve water into oils, breaking them up the globs of oil and "cleaning" them out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you've ever made brownies (I'm quite a pro) you may remember some recipes that call for a fraction of a cup of both water and oil. You mix them into a bowl (often with an egg) and you can immediately see that the oil and water don't mix. They just gel around each other. This happens because oil is nonpolar while water has a charge on both ends (remember how H20 is positive on one side and negative on the other -- it's ionic!) So since water has nothing to grab a hold of, it doesn't mix into the oil. Soap fixes this by being neutral on one end and polar on the other, acting as a bridge between the oil and the water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that's how soap cleans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is shampoo?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shampoo is essentially a soap with some other stuff mixed in, including water. I read that shampoo is actually 60-70% water and the soap component comes in a few different varieties, but the most common form are "sodium laurel ether sulphates." This term describes the chemical structure but the important thing for us to know is they are biodegradable and create a foaming effect when mixing into your hair. Other chemicals are added to thicken the shampoo and prevent bacteria growth (yummy!) and make it all smell like a summer rose garden. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What are the downsides of shampooing?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main one is indeed the gripe that I described earlier. Shampoo strips hair of its sebum, which is a natural, slightly yellow oily substance that glands in our skin secrete to keep our skin and hair moisturized. In the context of your head, sebum protects your hair shaft from getting brittle, dry, and breaking off. When shampoo strips that sebum away, hair can get in bad shape. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's why the shampoo industry invented conditioners, which replaces the natural sebum that shampoo removed with fake, manufactured sebum, that you get to buy at Walgreens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the chemical industry-inspired cycle we're supposed to follow goes something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dirt and sweat get in our hair through the process of being alive.- Rather than washing it out with water or a bit of soap, we're supposed to lather our whole head, twice even, and stripe our hair of dirt, sweat, and everything good that our body produces to keep our hair healthy.- Replace the good natural hair oils (sebum) with inferior chemical ones.- Repeat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I, for one, am not buying it, and neither should you. However, I understand it can be a bit jarring to make the change. Instead, I encourage you to try it out. Skip shampooing for a day, then two. Wash thoroughly with water instead. It may take a few days, but eventually, you won't notice a difference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll save money and let your body do what it's supposed to do: keep you healthy.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category><category term="personal"></category><category term="lifestyle"></category><category term="health"></category><category term="reflection"></category><category term="self-improvement"></category></entry><entry><title>Some great advice about how to stand out in local politics</title><link href="https://rbucks.com/2019/03/02/some-great-advice-about-how-to-stand-out-in-local-politics/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-03-02T22:04:00-08:00</published><updated>2019-03-02T22:04:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Ryan Buckley</name></author><id>tag:rbucks.com,2019-03-02:/2019/03/02/some-great-advice-about-how-to-stand-out-in-local-politics/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I recently drove out to Sacramento to try to see some old friends and public officials I know.

The folks on my list were Assemblymembers (https://a19.asmdc.org/),  (https://a16.asmdc.org/), and (https://a45.asmdc.org/). I tried to track down (https://twitter.com/jason_elliott), my friend from grad school who is now Governor Newsom's Chief Deputy Cabinet Secretary, but our timing was off, so I called up another grad school friend, (https://twitter.com/ZachNeumannCO), instead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It felt good to toggle my attention back over to local and state politics for a while. It'd been years since my last trip to Sacramento and I'd forgotten how busy it gets. Close to the capitol, it's all suits and ties and handshakes and ad hoc discussions between people carrying binders and iPads. It reminded me how much political infrastructure the state has. It also made me feel small. How can I make a dent in something this big?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest takeaway I got from my little field trip answered that question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's easy to make a name for yourself. Just do what you say you're going to do and you will stand out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since my conversations weren't on the record, I won't attribute it directly. The point this person made was clear: there are tons of people who talk a big game, who want attention and power, but who don't put in the work. Just by doing what you say you're going to do, even if it's as simple as sending an email, will make you stand out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people are not dependable. In politics, I was told, the number is something like 99 to 1. You can be in the top 1% simply by following through with your commitments, no matter how small they are. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, baby steps make a difference. Another important bit of advice was this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to be helpful to a public official, learn about what matters to them, and volunteer to support &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; agenda. Don't try to pull them over to yours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This point is brutally honest. Public officials are already pulled in multiple directions by community groups, public interest groups, and the media. If you're one person trying to establish a relationship, you'll be best served by beginning the relationship by being supportive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, I have work to do between now and when I throw my hat in the ring. There's a big wide gap between here and there.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category><category term="politics"></category><category term="local-politics"></category><category term="advice"></category><category term="career"></category><category term="government"></category></entry><entry><title>If I could redo all of my content marketing</title><link href="https://rbucks.com/2019/02/17/if-i-could-redo-all-of-my-content-marketing/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-02-17T21:56:00-08:00</published><updated>2019-02-17T21:56:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Ryan Buckley</name></author><id>tag:rbucks.com,2019-02-17:/2019/02/17/if-i-could-redo-all-of-my-content-marketing/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;If I could redo all of my content marketing, from every company I've ever worked on, I would keep this single, simple mantra in mind:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I certainly don't feel that about everything I've published. Perhaps the closest I've gotten to that is the (https://rbucks.com/the-parallel-entrepreneur/). I spent a lot of time on it and put a lot of planning into it. Outlines, research, conversations with people. That's probably what it takes to feel like I'm really &lt;em&gt;giving&lt;/em&gt; something valuable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is certainly aspirational. I don't expect to achieve this bar every time I click publish but I should be aware of when I don't reach that threshold. It's a good marker to go after. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get closer to it more often, I'll try to follow this process for future blog posts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write an outline first- Write in multiple sittings- Do a final reading before publishing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I did this with every blog post, not only would I publish better content, I think over time it would make me a better writer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post, perhaps ironically, did not have an outline but did get written over multiple sittings and did get a read-through. The first draft was kind of an outline, though.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My kneejerk, snarky answer would have been something along the lines of, “Nope! And guess what? I don’t care.” But that’s not what I said. I’ll paraphrase my reply:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You're right, I probably am damaged goods now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I say that not only because my investors lost their money on my last venture, but because I’ve been pretty forward about my feelings about venture capital in general, that it’s often not aligned with the interests of founders. My VCs didn't want my last venture to be a small success. It needed to be a huge exit or it needed to die. And so it died. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, you guys don’t need a multi-hundred million dollar exit to make your personal income statement pop. If you’ve raised a few million dollars then even a $10M exit will get you a house or at least a down payment on one, even after all the investors get paid (and they will get paid before you do.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A million bucks in your bank account is a life-changing event for you but your VC investors would call it a failure. They would compel you not to sell. That dichotomy is a real problem unless you also would shrug off anything less than a monster exit. So before you take VC money, be honest with yourself about how you define success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best way for me to redeem myself is to build another great company. If I can’t raise money for it then I’ll have to do it without funding. I’m already doing that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, given where my mind is at today, I think if my bootstrapped business needed to become a big company, I’d sell it before I fundraised for it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember this: if you can fundraise, you can sell. If you can sell for a multiple of what you took fundraised (or ideally you just bootstrap), then you can change your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But don’t take my word for it. Here’s a quote from John Mackey, the now-even-more-rich co-founder of Whole Foods (in case you missed it, he sold to Amazon for $13.7 billion), in his (http://one.npr.org/?sharedMediaId=527979061:528000104).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…We turned to venture capitalists, who I have learned are like hitchhikers with credit cards. They get in your car, and as long as you take them where they want to go, they will help pay for the gas. But if you get lost or wander off the road you promised you were going down, they will hijack the car, throw you out and bring in a new driver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My advice: be selfish. Take whatever exit that will change your life. And as for the VCs, let them eat cake.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category><category term="entrepreneurship"></category><category term="fundraising"></category><category term="bootstrapping"></category><category term="startups"></category><category term="reflection"></category></entry><entry><title>One-hundred-and-two</title><link href="https://rbucks.com/2018/12/31/one-hundred-and-two/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-12-31T21:25:00-08:00</published><updated>2018-12-31T21:25:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Ryan Buckley</name></author><id>tag:rbucks.com,2018-12-31:/2018/12/31/one-hundred-and-two/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Here’s a very short story I wrote earlier this year that encapsulates a lot of what 2018 was for me.

&lt;h4&gt;Read: The Great Alone&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My wife found (https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34912895-the-great-alone) and I have to say, the author Kristin Hannah is an artist. Her storytelling and character development is among the best I've ever read. I loved every page. I also read (https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22663563-the-nightingale) by Kristin Hannah and it is equally off-the-charts wonderful. It's a delicious, page-turning adventure that makes me feel good for reading it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will definitely read more of her stuff. She deserves all the fandom and accolades. This is an author who absolutely should be atop the charts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Write: On metered billing&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took my company, (https://www.findemails.com), and dramatically (https://rbucks.com/2018/06/12/moving-from-saas-to-metered-billing/) it is billed. Rather than charging a higher flat fee regardless of usage, I dropped everyone down to the same $9/mo plan and billed for usage. I knew this would drop my monthly recurring revenue (MRR) but I thought it would improve my other metrics. I might get more customers, fewer cancellations, and therefore earn back the lost MRR and then some over time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initial responses were promising. I'll have to write something again about it next month to see what really happens! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Play: Some Mozart&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When my (https://rbucks.com/2016/09/24/remembering-meredith/) I had a chance to rummage through the extensive collection of piano music he and my grandma accumulated over the 50 years they lived in their house. They had boxes and boxes of it and I only had a few minutes to look through them before I had to leave. We were picking up the piano that my dad inherited and bringing it the house we had recently purchased in Walnut Creek. The piano movers were almost ready to leave. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I picked up some old jazz standards that my grandma used to play and some very well-worn classical music, written up with decades-old notes from years of piano lessons and hours of practicing. This collection sits atop the piano today and one of my favorite picks from the pile is this collection of easy to play Mozart pieces. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm mostly pecking at them now but I will choose one to master. Probably next quarter.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category><category term="reading"></category><category term="writing"></category><category term="music"></category><category term="self-improvement"></category><category term="personal"></category></entry><entry><title>Lifestyle over money</title><link href="https://rbucks.com/2018/09/20/lifestyle-over-money/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-09-20T13:02:00-07:00</published><updated>2018-09-20T13:02:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Ryan Buckley</name></author><id>tag:rbucks.com,2018-09-20:/2018/09/20/lifestyle-over-money/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I reconnected with a few college friends recently who I rarely see.

They were overachievers — 3.95 GPAs at UC Berkeley (which is quite literally insane, especially in the poli sci and math departments they graduated from) — and went on to get great jobs and MBAs from Stanford and Harvard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They both have plenty of money, lots of friends, and well-established careers. It’s fun to reconnect and compare notes, tracking back to the dreams and ambitions we had and shared during our last years at Cal. Nearly 15 years on, we’re pretty much in the thick of real life. We’re starting families, buying homes, and making foundational decisions that are hard if not impossible to reverse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s the scary thing about being 36. We can see the cement of adulthood hardening all around us and we just have to hope that when it dries we’re happy with where we’re at because there’s really no going back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been out of the professional job market for about two years. That’s a long time in your mid-30s and I am well aware of the fact that every day I’m &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; holding an office job is another shovel deeper into this hole. Pretty soon I’m going to be unemployable, perhaps with a stigma around my time working from home. Or maybe I’ll come out of it “acquihired” into a larger company, fulfilling my stated mission to eventually sell these little businesses I’ve started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure, but one thing I am sure about is I’m not alone in feeling this way. These two illustrious friends of mine also struggle against the walls setting in all around them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over lunch at Wingtip, a swanky cigar and whiskey lounge in San Francisco, one friend told me she needs to have her “pivotal” position by 40 or 45 at the latest. If you haven’t had your career-changing role, the one they’d write your business school case study about by age 45, you’re not going to get one. Time’s up. People in their 50s don’t get these moonshots, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s her struggle. She recently quit her job at a startup in order to focus on starting a family. Well aware what this might do to her career, she’s anxious but still determined to focus on raising her first kid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My other friend started a hedge fund after business school and recently shut it down to work in the family office of one of his hedge fund’s LPs. It’s a great gig and he could potentially walk away with millions of dollars in a few short years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked him if he was happy. He shrugged and then cringed and said no, not really. I asked him what would make him happy. Hiking all day, he said. He just wants to go on hikes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He left to go back to work and my other friend and I talked a while. She’s intentionally unemployed and scheming to get back into the game. I’m semi-retired. I’m not rich but I have a rich lifestyle. I’m not actually retired but I can act like it. It’s the ultimate freedom that I described at length in (https://www.amazon.com/Parallel-Entrepreneur-start-businesses-keeping-ebook/dp/B07CG8SV5V/).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn’t tell my friend this but about those hikes? Yea, I do that. I also work until midnight sometimes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s the freedom that’s important. Freedom makes you happy, not the amount of money in the bank. I’m sure my balance sheet pales in comparison to these friends of mine, but am I equally happy, if not more? I think so.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category><category term="lifestyle"></category><category term="career"></category><category term="personal"></category><category term="reflection"></category><category term="entrepreneurship"></category></entry><entry><title>Read Write Play: Q2 2018</title><link href="https://rbucks.com/2018/06/28/read-write-play-q2-2018/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-06-28T23:04:00-07:00</published><updated>2018-06-28T23:04:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Ryan Buckley</name></author><id>tag:rbucks.com,2018-06-28:/2018/06/28/read-write-play-q2-2018/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Coming off an intense Q1, I reflected on knocking out my big accomplishment: writing a damn book and self-publishing it on Amazon.

The book launched in the #1 spot in New Releases in small business on the Amazon spots where it stayed for a week! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that was on my mind for my reading and writing this quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Read: The Originals&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read this book soon after (https://rbucks.com/the-parallel-entrepreneur/). I chose it because it seemed like the more professional, mainstream, "official" version of my own book. I'd never read Adam Grant before but this title was getting a lot of airtime on podcasts and on Twitter. I bought it and dove in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As expected, this was the perfect book selection. Several of the themes in &lt;em&gt;The Parallel Entrepreneur&lt;/em&gt; were confirmed by Grant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take this one, for example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Entrepreneurs who kept their day jobs had 33 percent lower odds of failure than those who quit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Adam Grant, &lt;em&gt;Originals&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This point is reinforced throughout &lt;em&gt;The Parallel Entrepreneur&lt;/em&gt;. Side projects are real assets, not distractions. And looking the other direction, your day job is also an asset to your side business. You're able to be more creative and take more risks on a longer time horizon when you have a regular paycheck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also really liked this point, which influences me to this day, and is the reason I continue to write and want to begin work on another book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simonton finds that on average, creative geniuses weren’t qualitatively better in their fields than their peers. They simply produced a greater volume of work, which gave them more variation and a higher chance of originality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Adam Grant, &lt;em&gt;Originals&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not just quality, it's quantity. It takes a lot of iterations to have a truly original, "genius" contribution to society. So let's get to the writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Write: I wrote about writing&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In (https://rbucks.com/2017/12/04/how-i-wrote-17k-words-in-just-two-days/), I wrote about my book-writing process. I took a really relaxing 3-day, 2-night writing retreat in Sonoma and knocked out about half of my book. I prepared for this trip with a thorough outline, an open calendar, and a lot of motivation. I'd never done something like this before and I was committed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's me crossing the 30,000-word mark that I was shooting for. That's a last-call Old Fashioned in my hand. It was about 11pm on my last night of the retreat. I started with 13,000 words in the document. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;!({static}/images/f1b51-1r6kq9ymy8_kogwoh68ompg.jpeg)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Play: Mayonaise&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was always my favorite song on the Siamese Dream album. I listened to that album backwards and forwards in high school. I loved the sorrow, angst, and power of the Smashing Pumpkins. Such a great band, and the combination of Billy Corgan's rhythm guitar riffs and Iha's melodic leads is grunge rock perfection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mayonaise has it all and for the first time in twenty years (why did it take me this long??) I learned the rocking power chords, and that lovely arpeggiating intro and solo. This song is one of my all-time favorites in any genre.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category><category term="reading"></category><category term="writing"></category><category term="music"></category><category term="self-improvement"></category><category term="personal"></category></entry><entry><title>What Can I Say</title><link href="https://rbucks.com/2018/06/12/what-can-i-say/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-06-12T18:27:00-07:00</published><updated>2018-06-12T18:27:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Ryan Buckley</name></author><id>tag:rbucks.com,2018-06-12:/2018/06/12/what-can-i-say/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’m a straight white guy with no physical disabilities.

&lt;p&gt;On days like today, Martin Luther King Day 2018, in the wake of #metoo and #shithole, a year after the Kaepernick Kneel, I tried to reflect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People don’t stare at me, judge me, ask themselves questions silently but still show it in their eyes. That’s not my experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I go about my blissful day in a suburb of the San Francisco Bay Area that was once named a conclave for the “Caucasian race” (it said so on my land deed which was written back in 1949) and waive to my mostly white neighbors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mom’s dad, Grandpa Irv, drew the connection between the oppression of blacks and the oppression of Jews. He marched in Selma when his children were barely teenagers and got arrested. He went to jail with Martin Luther King, Jr. It’s probably still his proudest moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His white neighbors weren’t as friendly as mine are. One of them spray painted “nigger lover” on the front of his house. My mom still remembers that day. It was a scary moment for her family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What can I say? I’m not prone to conflict, especially anonymous online conflict where it’s more like guerilla warfare than reasoned debate. I stopped trying to follow the Facebook and Twitter argument threads. I sometimes read the comments on a NY Times or Washington Post article that’s critical of the Trump administration but I don’t participate. Comments don’t change peoples’ minds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest concern I have right now is securing financial freedom in one of the toughest regions in our country to achieve it. It takes a majority of my time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe the biggest difference between me today and Grandpa Irv fifty years ago is I don’t see the injustice. It’s not in my face like it was if I’d been alive in late 50s and early 60s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not one to let something go when I see something I don’t like. Large or small. Whether it’s some crumbs on the floor or a bad business strategy, I need to clean it up. It bothers me if I don’t do something about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven’t yet been in an environment where the problem was overt racism, sexism, or other forms of bigotry. I haven’t experienced it directed at myself or someone I’m with. I don’t see it in my community. I hear about it beyond my bubble, I believe that others experience it out there, but I don’t see it and I don’t know them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And because of that, like most people, I focus on the problems that fill my space: dirty diapers, mortgage payments, and what to make for dinner. It can be all-consuming with two kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to believe that I would be driven to action if I saw something every day that I thought was unjust, hateful, or just plain wrong. So I’m looking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And maybe this is my ultimate reflection on Martin Luther King Day. We all should be looking. That’s what keeps it in the dark corners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t want hatred of anybody around my kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This way their experience will not be one of silent or overt oppression, too.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category><category term="personal"></category><category term="reflection"></category><category term="writing"></category><category term="creativity"></category><category term="expression"></category></entry><entry><title>My thyroid got cancer: one year later</title><link href="https://rbucks.com/2018/02/22/my-thyroid-got-cancer-one-year-later/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-02-22T22:45:00-08:00</published><updated>2018-02-22T22:45:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Ryan Buckley</name></author><id>tag:rbucks.com,2018-02-22:/2018/02/22/my-thyroid-got-cancer-one-year-later/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is a follow-up to my first article, (https://rbucks.com/2017/06/24/my-thyroid-got-cancer/).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ultrasounds are soothing. The whir of the machine, the doctor’s thoughtful grunts as she probes my neck, the crackle of the paper on the examination table. It is very familiar to me now. I relax into it and close my eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think about my kids. I see my older daughter sitting on the couch, her attention wafting between the television and me. She smiles and rolls onto her stomach. Her younger sister is there too, waddling around the living room, looking for attention. There’s sunshine coming through our large windows. It’s warm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s the scene in my mind every time I lie down on that examination table. It starts with the doctor squirting gel onto the ultrasound probe. It ends when she lifts the probe off my neck. The tension in the room lifts and I look at her face for signs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t get any.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently my endocrinologist was looking for a rogue lymph node that caused concern during my last ultrasound a month ago. She wanted to find it, pull out some tissue, and order a biopsy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We talked briefly and I laid down on the examination table. The paper crackled beneath me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Okay, let’s see where this thing is,” she said slowly and squirted that gel onto the ultrasound probe. I closed my eyes and saw my daughters again. The sun was still shining. I watched them play the game of chase they invented, running back and forth between the kitchen table and the mini lounge chairs they have near the couch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was sitting in my own lounge chair, wafting back and forth between my daughters and the ultrasound probe. I could tell something was up last time. The technician kept returning to one part of my neck. It lasted longer than usual. The next day I got the email I expected: they found an abnormal lymph node and I’d probably need to get a biopsy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today the ultrasound is also taking a while. My daughters looked at me, bored, asking what we were going to play next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t know,” I tell them, starting to feel nervous and agitated. “I thought you were going to keep playing chase?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ultrasound probe lifts and I’m brought back to the examination room. I shift my weight and the paper crackles beneath me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t think I got anything,” explained my doctor. “There’s so much tissue in the neck and these lymph nodes are really small. Every time I thought I saw it it disappeared again.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She punched some notes into the computer. “Let’s order you an MRI just to be safe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She explained that the MRI results would help her definitively identify any rogue lymph nodes and also help a neck surgeon find and remove any other cancers. I picked an appointment a few days later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An MRI is not relaxing. I closed my eyes as I was conveyed into the GE-branded plastic cave in a fancy trailer outside of my local Kaiser hospital. I wasn’t comfortable. My hair was caught behind my head, causing a slight pull that was just painful enough to prevent me from tuning it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then came the knocks, the chest-pounding thuds that reminded me of those times I’d find myself near the subwoofer at a nightclub. My clothes shook. I opened my eyes and looked through the Hannibal Lecter-like mask constraining my head. There was nothing to see so I closed my eyes again, forcing myself to think about something, anything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I pictured my girls but they looked scared, worried for me, confused about where I was and why I was so tense. I didn’t want to explain so instead I thought about work. I picked a programming problem and analyzed it. I had the full day ahead of me so I thought about what else I wanted to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How much longer? More knocking, screeching, buzzing. Finally, the tech tells me through the speaker that he’s going to pull me out and inject me with a solution to provide contrast to the “pictures” he was taking of my neck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great, more needles. I try to stay upbeat as he tries a couple of times to find my vein. I roll back into the cave and the symphony of jackhammers, machine guns, and subwoofing bass strikes up again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally I’m free. I thank the kind bearded man at the MRI controls and appreciate the endless sky above me. They asked me on the screening form if I was claustrophobic. I said no but now I’m not so sure. I really didn’t like being in that tiny plastic hole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then I waited for the results. I didn’t have to wait long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love my neighborhood for many reasons, but the biggest one is my neighbors. On my street there is a first grade teacher, a web designer, an executive director of an education non-profit, and a radiologist. A radiologist at Kaiser. The same Kaiser where I had my MRI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So of course in the days leading up to my ultrasound and MRI I gave him the play-by-play as our kids scooted around the cul de sac. He knows cancer better than anyone I know. He sees it every day, in every part of the body, and when I was first diagnosed he too told me that thyroid cancer is the best of them. He told me he would be working the morning of my MRI. When I left the trailer I texted him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;!({static}/images/9c923-1eqwcpmepbrtrzwhmzpt8ya.png)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That afternoon his two boys were out playing so I went out with my two girls, beer in hand. I could tell when he walked down the driveway that he didn’t want to tell me his read on my MRI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yea,” he began. “The node your endocrinologist couldn’t find? It’s there and I found a couple other irregular ones too.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn’t say anything yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“She’ll probably want to get them checked out. Sorry man.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked him a couple questions and then let my disappointment set in. I’d been optimistic, hopeful that whatever the original ultrasound found was simply due to one of the many winter bugs my daughter brought home from preschool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my inevitable googling of lymph node maladies I read that they swell and change shape when there’s an infection nearby. It was perfectly reasonable that an enlarged lymph node would be caused by a throat infection rather than cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My neighbor didn’t use the c-word but that uncertainty was the hardest part. My MRI was on the Friday of President’s Day weekend. I probably wouldn’t hear my endocrinologists’ read on it until Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That meant a whole weekend wafting in cancer limbo. I was able to tune it out, though, and decided to focus on things that I can control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can control how I feel. I can choose not to be nervous, anxious, and desperate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can control what I do. I can eat well, exercise, and do things that make me happy and remove other anxieties from my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can’t control cancers without medical help but I can at least manage what I feel and do. I reminded myself of this throughout that weekend and into the following week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I heard from endocrinologist and it was mostly good news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was delayed in getting back to me because she wanted a few more opinions on my chart. There was consensus that the irregularities in these lymph nodes in my neck were more likely caused by normal infections rather than cancers. She would bring my case to her monthly board review to get more feedback but that’s where it stands now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relief. For now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been intimately familiar with cancer for over a year already. It’s hard to put myself in the place I was before. Post-cancer I’m more grateful, more conscious, more vulnerable, more motivated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d never been “sick.” I don’t take aspirin or Tylenol or Advil when I get headaches. Before this cancer stuff I saw a doctor every two years. At the most. Now it’s every three months. Now I have to take two pills every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t like it but I’m getting used to it. I’m getting used to the latent uncertainty too, the anxiety that never goes away. That’s maybe the one thing that all cancer patients share. Some cases are worse than others. Most cases are worse than mine. But we all know that cancer can strike any time. It can come back, it can get worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That fact is you’re never really cancer-free. Sadly, no one is. You can spend your time worrying about that, a problem you can’t fix, or focus on what you can control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Control what you feel. Control what you do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That gives me power and that makes me happy.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category><category term="cancer"></category><category term="thyroid-cancer"></category><category term="health"></category><category term="personal"></category><category term="reflection"></category></entry><entry><title>The 3 things that mattered to me in 2017</title><link href="https://rbucks.com/2017/12/28/the-3-things-that-mattered-to-me-in-2017/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-12-28T14:36:00-08:00</published><updated>2017-12-28T14:36:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Ryan Buckley</name></author><id>tag:rbucks.com,2017-12-28:/2017/12/28/the-3-things-that-mattered-to-me-in-2017/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I can encapsulate my 2017 in three quick topics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Fatherhood&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year began with a very high high and a very low low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The high was Norah, born just a month before the new year. I was excited to be a new dad again and go into it seasoned this time. I wanted to soak it in, really enjoy it, not be as nervous as I was the first time around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The low was my (https://medium.com/@rbucks/my-thyroid-got-cancer-b11f4494fc6f), thyroidectomy, and the announcement I had to make at Scripted within a few days of my surgery that we were going to lay off all but six employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately it’s been nothing but up since January and the side benefit to all of these changes was being at home with my family. A lot. I was probably in an office for less than two weeks this entire year. I spent a lot of time with Norah every day and witnessed every little development. I loved it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I look back on 2017 I’ll remember the many hikes, smoothies, jogs to the park, and visits to the library that I did alone with Norah. Most dads never get this chance so I took full advantage of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Tom Petty&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I lost Tom Petty this year. His death hurt hurt more than Michael Jackson, more than Prince, more than Scott Weiland, Kurt Cobain, Chris Cornell, or any other musician I’ve admired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason is Tom Petty always felt timeless and ageless to me. He was always on tour, always sounded the same, always steady as a rock. Unlike most Super Bowl-tier musicians, he kept an even keel. He didn’t care about fame or fortune. He was never in the tabloids. He loved to make simple, beautiful music and I loved him for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Tom Petty song is pure, elegant, unobstructed, authentic. He didn’t have a stage persona. His performances were, for the most part, true to the albums and more importantly, true to himself. That’s how much he liked his own songs. He didn’t get tired of them, so I didn’t get tired of them either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know when I first discovered Tom Petty. In high school I was into 90's rock: Nirvana, Weezer, STP, Metallica, Soundgarden. Typical white suburban rollerblader kid music. That’s what I hear in my head when I think back to high school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that the soundtrack changes. When I took a road trip in 2006 and just headed out in my dark blue Cabrio east from Los Angeles I had two CDs on rotation, both were greatest hits albums. One was Bruce Springsteen and the other was Tom Petty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s what Tom Petty’s death did to me. It reminded me that I’m no longer that care-free 23-year-old guy driving down two-lane highways before Google Maps existed, the top down on my little convertible, singing “I Won’t Back Down” as the sun warmed my shoulders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can’t disappear on long road trips anymore, but I still have Tom’s music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Politics&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(https://medium.com/@rbucks/whats-next-for-me-a6418447d3d0) back in April and set three goals for the following 12 months. I’m now 75% of the way there and two of the three goals are done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Done: Be able to live on (https://www.toofr.com) and get a second revenue stream going too (that’s (https://www.inlistio.com)).- Done: Write a book on parallel entrepreneurship. Well, it’s &lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; done. I have a (http://www.parallelentrepreneurship.com/) and I wrote about my (https://medium.com/@rbucks/how-i-wrote-17k-words-in-just-two-days-2f1979f227a6).- In progress: Find my path into local politics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The political one has proven to be the most difficult because there’s no guide. There’s no data to measure against. It’s just a feeling of progress I have with every new connection I make, every insight I have on the local election scene in Contra Costa County, and every article I read about upcoming 2018 elections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be clear, I’m looking way out, probably 2022 because I’m starting from nothing. I have my fancy Harvard government degree but I don’t have a resume for local politics outside of my years on the UC Berkeley College of Natural Resources Alumni Association. I want to get plugged in and work my way up. I’ll also volunteer for one of my local 2018 state assembly campaigns so I can be certain I’m up to the task of running myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did register a campaign website though and will throw some links out once it’s ready. My online entrepreneurial instincts have kicked in: it’s never too early to start building SEO!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category><category term="personal"></category><category term="reflection"></category><category term="family"></category><category term="parenting"></category><category term="goals"></category></entry><entry><title>Learning to hike</title><link href="https://rbucks.com/2017/11/24/when-i-finally-learned-to-hike/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-11-24T20:42:00-08:00</published><updated>2017-11-24T20:42:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Ryan Buckley</name></author><id>tag:rbucks.com,2017-11-24:/2017/11/24/when-i-finally-learned-to-hike/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;!({static}/images/2b401-1ukfvhllbfjaefeqtqiufbq.jpeg)

&lt;em&gt;One of the many hiking trails&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;!({static}/images/4b59c-18ezr2ezsrhpgqzbzii_0pw.jpeg)
&lt;em&gt;Fall in Briones Regional Park, about 20 miles east of San Francisco.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I grew up going on hikes but it wasn’t until this year, at age 35, that I learned how to hike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a confession to make. My relatives may be shocked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the last 35 years I didn’t really enjoy hiking. It’s just something I did because I was raised going to a lakeside cabin every summer. I loved Pinecrest Lake— I still do — but I looked forward to the cooking, the swimming, the reading on the hammock. Hiking for me was a sideshow, not the main attraction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d hike for the sole purpose of reaching a destination like Cleo’s Bath, or Herring Creek, or around Pinecrest Lake to pick up some (https://medium.com/@rbucks/pinecrest-buttermilk-waffles-76709adc7c09) on the shore opposite my family’s cabin in the Sierras. I’d muster the energy and enthusiasm and head out and let my mind wander to pass the time faster between the start and the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My Aunt Harriet and Uncle Dan take a completely different approach. They drive all around Pinecrest to various trailheads and do day hikes. The hikes are the activity. It’s not about which lake they went to or what peak they summited. The whole point was to hike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I always admired this about them but I didn’t understand it. How could you just… hike? I should know this. I should be one of them. My family has this unique mountain legacy but I didn’t become a hiker until this year and I wasn’t converted at Pinecrest Lake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It all happened in Briones Regional Park with my second daughter in tow behind me. It only took me 35 years to learn how to hike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;!({static}/images/30b87-1eceqk8b_yj3-oshgzps3pg.jpeg)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;!({static}/images/5d035-1van61vku2xbysfmywgiiuw.jpeg)
&lt;em&gt;One of about 100 hikes in the past two years. This one was on Norah’s first birthday.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve now probably gone on 100 hikes all around the east bay. Short hikes, long hikes, some with my older daughter, some with my younger daughter, and always with (https://medium.com/@rbucks/the-ascent-of-blue-1da38dbe855b).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somewhere in those 100 hikes a change happened. A point on the map was no longer the destination. The hike itself became the point, and I learned how to really truly enjoy it. I’d pay attention to the creeks to my left and the crests to my right. I’d notice how the shrubbery changes when water is nearby and how grassy meadows smell differently than oak forests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also learned the logic behind trails. A straight long climb probably follows a waterway. Those are my favorite trails. Those climbs eventually leave the creek and start to zigzag up a hillside and then there’s usually a trail along the ridge and another one back down the other side. Eventually a trail will traverse back to reconnect the two. Those are favorite kind of loops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I now can tell how long a hike will take and I can keep a good sense of where the trailhead is relative to my position on the trail. I’ve never been lost (and fortunately Google has a lot of these trails mapped with accurate GPS placement) but with a baby on board it’s of course important to know how long it will take to get back to the car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m accustomed now to hiking with a 30 pound baby on my back, jabbering and sleeping and tugging at the back of my hat. I also now know that there is such thing as being in good hiking shape. The first time I did some of these climbs I was completely winded and had to stop a few times on the way up. Now I do it in one go and reach the top sweating but not out of breath. Hiking is not the same thing as walking and it is a really good workout. It took me about 25 hikes to figure that out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hiking no longer feels like work. I look forward to it every time. These days, with (https://medium.com/@rbucks/how-i-made-a-5-000-return-on-a-fancy-2-day-vacation-21b9100d3fb5) and without a nanny on Wednesdays and Fridays, I take Norah hiking while most dads are at work. Two hours on the trail in the morning goes by fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do I want to find a new trail or do an old loop? How far out do I want to drive this time? How long ago did it rain? Does it look like the trail follows a creek?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the the questions that hikers ask. I’m glad to be among them.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category><category term="hiking"></category><category term="fitness"></category><category term="personal"></category><category term="reflection"></category><category term="lifestyle"></category></entry><entry><title>Why SaaS is a solo founder’s dream come true</title><link href="https://rbucks.com/2017/11/23/why-saas-is-a-solo-founders-dream/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-11-23T19:51:00-08:00</published><updated>2017-11-23T19:51:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Ryan Buckley</name></author><id>tag:rbucks.com,2017-11-23:/2017/11/23/why-saas-is-a-solo-founders-dream/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The dream is 100 customers paying you $100 per month.

That’s the software-as-a-service (SaaS) solopreneur’s mecca.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A hundred customers paying $100 per month adds up to $120,000 per year of revenue. Since we’re building software, you’ll have about 85% gross margins, so your gross profit is at least $100,000. Your operating expenses are business-related assets and advertising activities, some of which will neatly cross over into your personal life (tax write-off for your home office, for example). Let’s say those expenses cost another $30,000 per year, so your “in-the-bank” net profit is $70,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s it. That’s the big picture. That’s what you’re shooting for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a business that makes enough income for you to pay rent, even if you live in San Francisco or New York. If your home base is anywhere else, then you’re living like self-made royalty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may still need your spouse or partner’s income to save for a house and take nice vacations, but what you’ve done with your $120K business is bought yourself time and flexibility. You might even keep your day job. Or you’ll start building a second $120K business because your first one pretty much runs itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s what it means to be a (https://medium.com/@rbucks/parallel-entrepreneurship-defined-34b2a1cca624). You don’t wait until your plate is empty in before you start another business. You just spin another one up and see if it grows as nicely as your first one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s “and” — not “or” — when you’re clearing $10K month with a SaaS business that runs itself. You can pretty much do anything you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few points about how to make this work:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sell to businesses&lt;/strong&gt;: Businesses don’t mind spending $100 per month. For most of them you’ll fly right under the radar during those inevitable months when they barely log into your product. Businesses these days are conditioned to accept monthly software fees. Take advantage of it!- 
&lt;strong&gt;Pick a problem that’s never really solved&lt;/strong&gt;: The beautiful thing about sales leads is you never stop needing them. That’s why (https://www.toofr.com) is a great little business. When it works (it finds good emails and generates good leads) it makes the users (sales reps and recruiters) want more. So the monthly nature of the billing actually makes sense!- 
&lt;strong&gt;Automate as much as humanly possible&lt;/strong&gt;: If you’re going to actually enjoy running a small business yourself or keep your team lean enough so you’re able to keep a ratio of $100K in profit per employee, then you need to automate. A lot. Often that means signing up for other people’s software products.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will take some time to get there on a bootstrapped shoestring budget, but you’ll get those 100 customers eventually. Just stick to the gameplan and stay tuned into your market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category><category term="saas"></category><category term="entrepreneurship"></category><category term="bootstrapping"></category><category term="business-strategy"></category><category term="finance"></category></entry><entry><title>Hiring feels a lot different when it's your own money</title><link href="https://rbucks.com/2017/11/01/hiring-feels-a-lot-different-when-its-your-own-money/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-11-01T13:08:00-07:00</published><updated>2017-11-01T13:08:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Ryan Buckley</name></author><id>tag:rbucks.com,2017-11-01:/2017/11/01/hiring-feels-a-lot-different-when-its-your-own-money/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I recently posted a (https://www.toofr.com/jobs) to help me with a bunch of tactical stuff for Toofr.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I need help writing, SEO position tracking, supporting customers, and generally moving the ball downfield on all of my websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I posted on Craigslist, HireClub, and Remoteok.io. Over the last few days I received about 50 emails and set up calls with a dozen of them. I’ve asked two of those people I called to do a SEO assignment for me as a final step. I’m currently waiting to hear back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s been a nerve-wracking experience. Here’s why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel really sensitive about compensation. The rest of the process was, for the most part, by the hiring playbook we developed at Scripted. We simply offered market rates, maybe a bit lower, and that was that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason I feel differently now, of course, is obvious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Scripted, and this would be true for any venture-backed startup, you’re not really spending your own money. If you make a mistake, it hurts, but it doesn’t impact your own paycheck. You shrug it off and try again, careful not to waste any additional time and money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Toofr, it’s not that simple. The money I’m paying to this marketer is coming directly out of my paycheck. It’s basically like I’m opening up my own wallet and paying them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve hired contractors before but that was before Toofr became my main source of income. When it really was just a side project I felt more generous. I cared less and, frankly, I didn’t have a choice. I needed the help because I was at Scripted all day and if Toofr broke I needed someone else to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; do everything but it’s probably not the &lt;em&gt;best &lt;/em&gt;thing for me to do. I need to specialize if Toofr’s going to graduate into the $30K MRR club.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you’re bootstrapped the stakes are higher. Hiring the wrong person is not something you can just shrug off if you don’t get right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time it’s much more personal.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category><category term="entrepreneurship"></category><category term="hiring"></category><category term="bootstrapping"></category><category term="toofr"></category><category term="business-strategy"></category></entry><entry><title>The definition of parallel entrepreneurship</title><link href="https://rbucks.com/2017/10/27/parallel-entrepreneurship-defined/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-10-27T20:20:00-07:00</published><updated>2017-10-27T20:20:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Ryan Buckley</name></author><id>tag:rbucks.com,2017-10-27:/2017/10/27/parallel-entrepreneurship-defined/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;!({static}/images/a2d87-16ltjqklmrny90acqqj8vvg.jpeg)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the concept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You don’t quit your day job and then build a startup. You build a startup and then quit your day job.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s no reason anymore to go full-time into any one thing. If you have the itch to try your …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;!({static}/images/a2d87-16ltjqklmrny90acqqj8vvg.jpeg)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the concept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You don’t quit your day job and then build a startup. You build a startup and then quit your day job.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s no reason anymore to go full-time into any one thing. If you have the itch to try your hand at starting a business, then you should do it while your employer limits your risk with a regular paycheck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing a lot of people seem to forget is that you can start and run and grow a real business that makes a meaningful amount of money just during nights and weekends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It does mean some amount of sacrifice. You won’t be able to do this and keep up with the latest Warriors trades and Game of Thrones episodes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But these are much better sacrifices to make than losing a paycheck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here’s why it’s important. It’s getting harder and harder to raise equity financing. The bar is so high by the time you actually check all the investors’ boxes you wouldn’t actually need their money anymore. When you’re a new entrepreneur the finance guys need to de-risk as much as possible and they do that by asking you to be flawless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, it’s getting harder and harder to earn revenue. Customers are getting harder to grab because starting internet businesses is getting easier. Simply put, there’s more competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve recently launched my sixth website app in the last 12 months. Of those six, only two are making money. My main source of income now, (https://www.toofr.com), was a side business I started nearly four years ago. Now I live off of it and with every new venture I start, I’m even more grateful to have even one business that works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took that long — four years of nights and weekends—to get this business to a state where I can live comfortably off of it. It seems these days it might take four years of full-time effort to yield the same result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having multiple income streams is the ultimate insurance. It’s the same idea that financial fund managers use. Better to diversify your investments. Don’t be all in on tech stocks or bonds or index funds. You should mix high risk and low risk investments whenever possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors don’t move their money serially. They don’t go 100% into stocks, then 100% into bonds, and then move everything into some other instrument?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No way! They hold a mixture of all them simultaneously. In parallel. Spread across multiple markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should do the same with your career. You don’t need to rely on a spouse or partner to have the stable or high risk job. You can have them both, yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So go and be a parallel entrepreneur. Build a startup while keeping your day job.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category><category term="parallel-entrepreneurship"></category><category term="entrepreneurship"></category><category term="business-strategy"></category><category term="career"></category><category term="advice"></category></entry><entry><title>Being good at computer programming</title><link href="https://rbucks.com/2017/10/09/why-im-good-at-programming/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-10-09T21:22:00-07:00</published><updated>2017-10-09T21:22:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Ryan Buckley</name></author><id>tag:rbucks.com,2017-10-09:/2017/10/09/why-im-good-at-programming/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’m not a “good” programmer but I am “good at” programming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s the difference? Let me explain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good programmers write beautiful, optimized code. They write good tests and enjoy doing it. They know Javascript and Ruby and can quickly pick up other languages too. They don’t need to spend time Googling error messages because their code doesn’t produce errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I’m good at programming because I’m confident. I’ll plow into a problem, break it into a bunch of smaller pieces, and solve them. That what it means to be “good at” programming. It’s being a good problem solver by being good at seeing the smaller, easier problems inside the larger, scarier one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My code reflects this approach. My methods are the small problems and my classes are the big ones. It’s how I built (https://www.toofr.com) and (https://www.inlistio.com). Usually when there are bugs, it’s a problem in a method, not in a whole class. My classes are good because they inherently make sense in the context of the really big picture, the app itself, and the large problems within the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m good at programming now because I’m not afraid of it. Nothing is too complicated. There’s only learning curves and time and the cost of that time. At this point I feel like I could program anything if I had the time to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s all very logical, and when I sit down for a couple of hours to program, my left brain continues to buzz for an hour after I stop. It’s like heavy breathing after a good long exercise. It takes a while to catch your breath. This is why I have to stop programming at least an hour before I want to fall asleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s actually why I’m writing this post right now at 10pm in the evening. Left brain, you had a good night tonight. Now it’s time to rest.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category><category term="programming"></category><category term="technology"></category><category term="software-development"></category><category term="personal"></category><category term="reflection"></category></entry><entry><title>My favorite question to ask</title><link href="https://rbucks.com/2017/10/09/my-favorite-question-to-ask-myself/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-10-09T21:07:00-07:00</published><updated>2017-10-09T21:07:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Ryan Buckley</name></author><id>tag:rbucks.com,2017-10-09:/2017/10/09/my-favorite-question-to-ask-myself/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;These days I don’t have a lot of structure between 9am and 4pm.

&lt;p&gt;At any given point in that 9–4 window I can pretty much do whatever I want because my business doesn’t rely on me. I can ignore it for a day or even a week and it’ll still make money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This presents a new, unusual challenge: what am I supposed to do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve begun asking myself a new question: &lt;strong&gt;What would be most fulfilling to do right now?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fulfillment comes in many forms. There’s a leisurely fulfillment, like when I just want to sit in my hammock and watch an hour-long episode of The Sopranos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s also a stress-reduction fulfillment, usually related to a bug that’s bothering some Toofr users, and I know it’s going to open a wormhole, so I keep pushing it off. I summon the power to tackle it by reminding myself how good it will feel to fix it and put that buzz in my head to rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there’s the enrichment fulfillment, which I (https://medium.com/@rbucks/three-life-hacks-i-wish-i-did-more-often-5d22bc572a55). Per that last tip, I will spend some time reading, playing, or writing (not work-related writing) and not feel guilty about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I can give myself the mental space to ask myself this question every day, I think not only will I be happier, but my business will be better off too. I find that when I return from a fulfillment activity, even if it’s work-related, it’s really gratifying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was in control for that moment, directed my attention towards something, and completed it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These small victories add up.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category><category term="personal"></category><category term="reflection"></category><category term="self-improvement"></category><category term="philosophy"></category><category term="life-lessons"></category></entry><entry><title>Open the gate</title><link href="https://rbucks.com/2017/09/18/open-the-gate/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-09-18T11:42:00-07:00</published><updated>2017-09-18T11:42:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Ryan Buckley</name></author><id>tag:rbucks.com,2017-09-18:/2017/09/18/open-the-gate/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve thought a lot about running for office.

I studied it in college and in graduate school but I decided to take a detour through the private sector to get some practical experience and financial cushion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three years ago I started a family and just recently decided that I should prioritize a lifestyle that lets me maximize family time. So I’m doing that now, spending most of my day with my youngest daughter and working on (https://www.toofr.com) and other projects during her naps and at night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result I’m at home or in the neighborhood all the time now and I love it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before long, however, both of my kids will be in school and I’ll probably get restless, so over the next five or ten years I should be able to increase my focus beyond my immediate family and finally pursue my public sector ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think platforms should simple. To that end, mine would consist of these three E’s: Education, Economy, and Environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Education&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went to public schools all the way through college, when I graduated from the best public school of them all, UC Berkeley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m lucky to have lived with my mom in a great school district in Mountain View, California. I went to the same elementary school and middle schools as Steve Jobs. My high school sent more than 20 of us to UC Berkeley when I graduated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had great teachers, great resources, and at home I had a great environment to study and explore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This stuff isn’t free and it’s not freely available. One of the most important duties of government is to equitably distribute essential education. Governments often fail to do so. That’s why education, even though it’s in pretty good shape in Lamorinda, the nickname for the area where I live around the cities of Lafayette, Moraga, and Orinda, is first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Economy&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I studied business and I’ve started businesses. I love building teams, companies, and making money doing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the area we live in, money is essential. There’s no way around it. An active, expanding economy that pays for good, real work benefits everybody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not against accumulation of wealth. I’ve written about how I’m trying to accumulate some myself. I am against excessive accumulation of wealth for goods or services that benefit small slivers of the economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When part of an economy expands while others stay flat or decline, it’s not good. It’s also not sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a public official, my economic policy would revolve around the philosophy that government should not stifle growth, but it should be very critical of inequalities in where the growth is happening, and intervene and correct when necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Environment&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“…because trees and animals can’t protect themselves.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s why I support environmental regulations. It’s about as simple a rationale as I can think of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To paraphrase the political philosopher John Rawls, we should design policies that support the most vulnerable populations. He asked what rules you might choose if you had no knowledge about your own social class and would be subjected to those rules upon birth. This thought experiment is known as the “(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veil_of_ignorance).”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I extend that concept to the natural world. I believe we are absolutely dependent on a healthy planet. To treat the natural world like a non-essential, expendable resource to be taken advantage of is short-sighted and tragically wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, ten years out from my formal education on environmental sciences and policy, I am admittedly tainted by real life. If people have to choose between themselves or their families and the environment, the environment will always lose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe I’d agonize more over it, but I know I’d still put my family first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the role of government here is to try to not make people chose. Don’t put the birds and the trees in a position where they’ll always lose. To the extent sacrifices have to be made, and I believe it is inevitable, find the way where the environment loses least. That’s the essence of my environmental policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope within ten years I’ll have gone out there and done it. I hope I’ll have opened the gate. I hope that if I put myself out there and lost an election that I did not get disheartened. I hope I tried it at least one more time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I’ll be a good public servant. I’m going to use the next five or ten years figuring out how to make it happen.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category><category term="personal"></category><category term="reflection"></category><category term="writing"></category><category term="creativity"></category><category term="goals"></category></entry><entry><title>Parallel entrepreneur profile: John Zimmer, Lyft</title><link href="https://rbucks.com/2017/08/14/parallel-entrepreneur-john-zimmer-lyft/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-08-14T11:06:00-07:00</published><updated>2017-08-14T11:06:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Ryan Buckley</name></author><id>tag:rbucks.com,2017-08-14:/2017/08/14/parallel-entrepreneur-john-zimmer-lyft/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;John Zimmer studied hospitality management at Cornell.

He graduated in 2006 and joined Lehman Brothers, a prestigious investment bank, in order to get a better finance background but found himself bored within the first year of a two-year analyst program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Logan Green, a friend of a friend, posted on Facebook that he was building a carpooling website, John got interested. A course he took in college emphasized that overconsumption of resources will ultimately threaten human survival. The lessons stuck with him but he wasn’t inspired yet to work on a solution. The carpooling service idea struck a chord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time, Logan was in Santa Barbara and John was working in New York City. The two connected online and met for the first time in person when Logan traveled to New York a few weeks later. They hit it off and decided to collaborate on Logan’s idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John stayed at Lehman Brothers for another year while Logan built the website and John hammered away on marketing campaigns and partnerships at college campuses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He kept his day job while working on a side project that had no overlap or potential conflicts.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2008, when Zimride, the carpooling site, was running and making money, he quit Lehman Brothers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friends and family thought he was crazy. “Why would you quit on a sure thing like Lehman?” they’d ask.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman Brothers went bankrupt three months later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And like many young couples in San Francisco, after our first child was born we felt a magnetic pull to the suburbs. While my wife was researching neighborhoods and more practical things, I’d been scouring the internet to find a dog. And not just any dog. I needed a male chocolate lab, and I needed to name him Blue. The make and model of my dog-to-be was one of those requirements that can’t be explained. My mind was set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked at professional breeders with online booking forms and waiting lists. I looked at rescue dogs and local pound listings. I didn’t want a professional hunting dog, and I didn’t feel comfortable bringing a pound puppy home to our young daughter. I kept looking, getting particularly interested in home-based, amateur breeders on Craigslist. It seemed like a dog in that environment would have the right temperament for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I found it. There was a breeder in Oakley with a litter of American Kennel Club-approved labrador pups expected to be born around Halloween. We were scheduled to get the keys to our house in Walnut Creek about a month later, and we planned to actually move in about a month after that. Puppies can’t go home for 8–9 weeks after birth, so that timing was perfect, if moving into a new house with a one-year-old girl and a 9-week-old puppy is indeed perfect (spoiler alert: it’s not).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The morning of the day that we picked up the keys to our house I drove out to the breeder’s house in Oakley with my wife and daughter to choose my puppy. I’d never done this before and didn’t have a clue what to look for. I was hoping for a sign or an omen. I wanted my daughter to choose the puppy for me, or for one of them to come galavanting out to greet us, like in the movies. It didn’t happen that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The breeder and her family greeted us, friendly as could be, and she showed me the two remaining male chocolate labs in the litter. She brought them out of the cage in her living room and let me hold them. They both were tiny pups, but one was noticeably bigger than the other. I figured larger size at this point meant more milk and better health, so I chose the bigger guy. I remember looking at his pudgy nose, wondering why it was so flat and if there was something wrong with it. The breeder didn’t say anything so I didn’t either. His nose turned out fine, of course. Here’s a picture of that day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;!({static}/images/5a4fb-1s4wym6hh9fkmocvp7f9jrg.jpeg)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;My baby boy and my baby girl.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I chose my dog and then we drove to our new home to officially get the keys from our broker. Some neighbors were out in the court to greet us and a second relief passed over me. They were really friendly people and they also had dogs. Blue would have some friends in the neighborhood too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My second trip to Oakley two months later was on another busy day. My family flew up from Los Angeles earlier that morning after visiting my in-laws for Christmas. We drove home to Walnut Creek from the airport. After we cleared the car I immediately jumped back in for the half-hour drive back to Oakley to take our Blue Boy home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;An ominous start&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was late December 2015 and the east bay was in a bitter cold snap. Before we left for our weeklong trip to Southern California I’d been playing with the wireless thermostat for our new air conditioner and in trying to connect it to our wifi, I messed up the heating settings. The furnace blew only cold air, so my wife couldn’t heat the house when we got home. I wanted to fix it before picking up Blue but it was getting late. The breeder made a point of telling me that Blue was the last of his siblings to be picked up. I needed to go get him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I arrived the breeder told me that she was secretly hoping I’d never show up. Her family spent Christmas with Blue and she said it was wonderful, that he’s a special dog. They were becoming attached. She also told me that he was always the first dog in the litter to smell his mom when she approached. She said that’s an early sign of love and loyalty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thanked and paid the breeder, picked up the vaccination and AKC paperwork, and made two stops on the way home. The first was to Petco to pick up Blue’s dog food and his first chew toys, where he got many compliments as we explored the aisles in my shopping cart. The next stop was to Ace to get a heater for the house, on urgent text message request from my wife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;!({static}/images/35831-1z4teedqyumj7pyvsmoaiqg.jpeg)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blue, master of the house.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sun was setting when I finally got home and was greeted by my frazzled, cold wife and runny-nosed daughter. She had already made plans to stay at a hotel that night, leaving Blue Boy at home with me. I put on some music and found the setting I messed up on that blasted thermostat while Blue Boy watched in confused amusement. The house was warm again and I was home alone with my dog. In that moment I was relieved and happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;!({static}/images/37095-1fdw3ldootscekn9mlbhedw.jpeg)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our first night together. He fell asleep to Beatles music.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;!({static}/images/ee296-10zg998uzwrd5p7erwlmvaw.jpeg)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lily greeting her new furry bro the next morning. Lots of runny noses that winter.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following months would be challenging. We needed a new deck in the backyard and new windows throughout the house. My wife was contracting for her employer back then and my daughter was at home with her full-time. I commuted to San Francisco and had a lot going on at Scripted as we continued to deal with typical startup challenges. I couldn’t help with the puppy, leaving my wife with what must have felt like two kids as workers came in and out and Blue whined and yelped with excitement. Mix in a cold and rainy winter with a smattering of my evening work events, and you wind up with a few text messages like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;!({static}/images/63358-1alz5o1o6nppif1meyxjavq.png)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having a puppy and a toddler at the same time is hard. Our timing was off, but I didn’t know any better. We should have waited until she was older so her toys wouldn’t look so much like puppy toys. He chewed more plastic baby gifts than I can count, including her first potty, her first swing, and one of our two grey couch pillows. Even (https://medium.com/@rbucks/the-most-expensive-chair-possible-b958ee4d7ebe) ottoman has puppy teeth marks on it. He also liked to tear up his own beds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;!({static}/images/603c1-1sswkwyimgxrzn-11kfkdqw.png)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t all bad news, though. He and Lily became fast friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;!({static}/images/5360f-1bgzhbdpasu1_v10s8t6drg.jpeg)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;!({static}/images/92376-1rw0fji64zjr7dumgq7u5za.jpeg)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They bonded and as they both grew they figured out how to play well together. She forgave him when his puppy energy knocked her over, and no one could get her to laugh more than Blue Boy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;!({static}/images/be697-1ext0ajfrgg12hcxvem5aqw.png)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;!({static}/images/08c13-1wjzcc36p-1_pl_hx5w4daa.png)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, I admit to getting annoyed with him when I’d give something to Lily and he would bolt over, ears perked, expecting something too. If we brought a bunch of Lily’s toys out, he’d start playing with whatever she wasn’t playing with. And by playing, I really mean chewing. We’d have to limit the number of toys out and pick them up as soon as she was done playing with them. It was more work for us, and when my wife became pregnant again, that extra work became increasingly difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we got to know him better, we found out more about what makes him special. First of all, he had very few accidents in the house. One or two solids and maybe five total wet ones. Within a couple of weeks of being in our house he was using the doggy door regularly. He’d go in and out, all day and all night, as he pleased. He was a quick study in the bathroom department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also had one huge surprise for us. He never barked. If he was a barker we wouldn’t have been able to keep the doggy door available to him all the time. Plus, with sleeping babies in the house, this is huge. UPS and DoorDash people would come to our door and Blue wouldn’t make a peep. He could sense that it was okay. The few times that we had people come to our house at night and I wasn’t in the room with him, only then would he bark. His guard dog instincts kick when it matters. I didn’t teach him that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only sounds he makes are whines and “Hey, what about me?” cries when we’re in the front yard and he’s left in the backyard. Those get annoying too, but he’s toned them down a lot in the last few months. He recently turned a corner with all of us, but most especially with my wife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we’ve grown to know him, I think he has also grown to know and love us. In the mornings before my older daughter wakes up he lays down by her door and waits for her. It’s really sweet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;!({static}/images/67c1d-1qptdt2nzwkq578z9kpxisa.jpeg)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blue waiting for Lily to wake up.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I take him running anywhere. We go to parks, into the hills, and to Peet’s to get coffee and muffins. When it’s not too hot, we jog over to my daughter’s preschool to pick her up. She loves seeing him there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On summer evenings when the kids are in bed, he and I will sit out on the lounge chairs on our back deck and watch evening turn to dusk. The only lab I’ve known as well as Blue was my grandpa’s yellow lab, Bowie, but she wasn’t the lap dog that Blue is. He’ll put his huge head down on my lap and close his eyes, letting my hands brush across his forehead and velvety ears. Those quiet times are my favorite moments with Blue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;!({static}/images/7d045-1jev8rp3x_det3yfsajxvyw.jpeg)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Beauty and the Beast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clocking in at 100 pounds, he’s able to do some accidental damage to my oldest and youngest family members, but so far, seven months along with my second daughter, he’s never caused tears. Not once. She crawls over to him now and pulls herself up onto his shiny brown torso. He’ll look surprised at first and then plop his big head down, let out a sigh, and allow her to do whatever she wants with him. When my older daughter does the same, he treats it more like a game and gives her little kisses. He seems to know that the baby is vulnerable and when she’s near him he can’t roll over or nuzzle her. He’s stuck at this point and knows he’s not allowed to move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who get to know Blue tell me he’s the best labrador they’ve ever met. My mother-in-law is a dog trainer and tells me this too. It’s not that he’s particularly well-trained. He knows no tricks but he’ll come and sit and lie down on command. I think Blue’s real gifts are not in what he does, but in what he doesn’t do. He doesn’t bark, he doesn’t growl, and he doesn’t get angry or frustrated. He’s happiest when he’s around us and when we’re happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read somewhere that the bond between humans and dogs has been evolving for millennia now. The first wolves were tamed a long, long time ago and the friendliest offspring were mated for hundreds of generations. What I now have loafing around my house these days is the pinnacle of that evolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’re my boy, Blue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;!({static}/images/ad58a-1kdfzvuhwh10kkryxsz7rjq.jpeg)&lt;/p&gt;

A lot of people liked it, but not everyone did. I expected that. I decided that I would follow the thread of truth wherever it led, even around the murky bends that are difficult to write about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The (https://medium.com/@rbucks/the-story-behind-our-layoffs-699c2d2eea53) in particular struck a chord. I got a lot of feedback from distant friends, and even an early Scripted writer. This is what he wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;!({static}/images/26acc-1pxb2ui3ik47qb8lcvwmudg.png)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Truth is hard to find. It’s also hard to hear. I’m finding that honesty is a great filter. The people who I respect and want to spend more time with and learn more from respond well to it. They engage with me, ask questions, and make me probe deeper. I really appreciate it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here’s some more honesty: we’re not yet profitable, but I shaved anyway because we’re damn close. Also that beard was making my face itch all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That itching was kind of the point. I knew making a run for profitability would not be comfortable. There would be hard decisions to make and things to say no to that we otherwise wouldn’t say no to. That’s the discipline I really truly honestly believe was missing for the last three years at Scripted. We gained investor money and lost our grip on reality. We’re not alone, to be sure, but that doesn’t lessen the blow. We could have and should have learned from the mistakes of others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month we did more revenue per dollar spent than we’ve ever done. We had 3X the membership revenue in March 2017 than we did in May 2016, and we did it with one quarter of the sales and marketing spend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In other words, we made a 300% increase in revenue while simultaneously decreasing revenue acquisition spend by 75%.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our profit also beat our payroll for the first time in years, maybe ever. It’s remarkable, really. So I shaved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope these are the last selfies I ever post online. I’m including them only because it’s the best picture I have of my personal development over the last couple of months. My beard grew in thick. I got compliments, but it’s not me (and neither is the mustache.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the best part of this profitability process, and the one that will stay with me for the rest of my career is that I really, &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; like running a normal, profitable business. One that cares, a lot, about how much money it’s making and losing every month and is working &lt;em&gt;every day&lt;/em&gt; to narrow the gap. In that sense we’re like the millions of SMBs outside of Silicon Valley, and I think that’s a very good thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="tiled-gallery__col"&gt;!({static}/images/df898-1yltx8w5qoxdqlrkrwmgs8g.jpeg)!({static}/images/b1dd9-1zbo30nkxqxxd0h2fwhutiq.jpeg)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growth is great. When high growth leads to big companies, that’s great too. It can happen naturally when your product works and makes people happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I no longer want to grow to become a public company with hundreds of employees and multiple offices. If Scripted ever gets there, I can guarantee that I won’t be CEO at that point. It’s just not me. It’s not what I want to do, it’s not what’s interesting to me, and I don’t need the money or the prestige you get from doing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for what’s next in the immediate future for Scripted, it’s all good news, but I’m not saying what it is yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there’s one thing you can count on, though, it’s that &lt;strong&gt;Scripted don’t quit.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category><category term="personal"></category><category term="lifestyle"></category><category term="reflection"></category><category term="humor"></category><category term="self-improvement"></category></entry><entry><title>Buckley’s grilled cowboy rib eye steaks</title><link href="https://rbucks.com/2017/01/02/buckleys-grilled-cowboy-rib-eyes/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-01-02T12:18:00-08:00</published><updated>2017-01-02T12:18:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Ryan Buckley</name></author><id>tag:rbucks.com,2017-01-02:/2017/01/02/buckleys-grilled-cowboy-rib-eyes/</id><summary type="html">&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the recipe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get some big ass cowboy rib eye steaks. Bone-in because you’re not a wimp and you’re willing to pay $17 …&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the recipe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get some big ass cowboy rib eye steaks. Bone-in because you’re not a wimp and you’re willing to pay $17 per pound for some carbon. Seriously, shell out. These two bad boys costed $64 at Whole Foods. Hurt so good!- Sprinkle LIBERALLY with salt. Yes, like Bernie Sanders liberally.- Use a rub if you have one. I got a thoughtful present of various Williams Sonoma rubs and appreciate the simplicity of it. It’s a higher level of abstraction than looking up a recipe, discovering I’m missing the damn nutmeg, and wondering if that’s why the taste is off. It’s not wimpy to use a rub.- Let them sit at room temperature for 30–60 minutes before grilling. I’m not sure why, but every damn grilling blog on the planet says you should, so I will too. And I did it and although I’m not sure what effect it had, my steaks turned out GREAT.- Because they’re so thick, you have to do the “reverse sear.” That just elitist grilling speak for “save the direct flame for the end.” Your steak might look weird for the first 30 mins, but it’s ok. They’ll be fine.- So, warm the grill to about 350 degrees. Keep the temp between 325 and 350 the entire time. Since I have three burners, I put the outer two burners on low and kept the middle burner off. Works a treat.- Both of these steaks are 2.5–3in thick, and I set a timer for 17 minutes per side. I only flipped once.- For the sear, I turned up the flame on one side of the grill and put both steaks over it for 2 mins. Then flipped and set the 2 min timer again.- By the way, for all of these cooking times, you’re cooking with the lid closed. You know that, ya?- Also, if you have kids like me or are highly distracted for other reasons, the timer is a good idea. You don’t want to overcook your $64 steaks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I’ll tell you what. This was the best steak I’ve ever made. It was kind of by accident too. I have Instacart to thank. Let me explain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to grill a good rib eye on my last weekend of paternity leave / winter break / 2016. Having two kids now and all, going grocery shopping is a bridge too far, so we were delighted when Instacart showed up in Walnut Creek. I put 2 pieces down in my order and was more than shocked when I saw the $64 tag on the meat wrapper. Wow. I never would have done it if I’d done the shopping in person. But I’m so glad my Instacart person knew me so well. This person isn’t afraid to throw down for the best steak on earth, he or she must have thought. Let’s go big.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you, mystery shopper!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category><category term="food"></category><category term="cooking"></category><category term="recipes"></category><category term="grilling"></category><category term="personal"></category></entry><entry><title>I don't have a dishwasher</title><link href="https://rbucks.com/2017/01/01/i-dont-have-a-dishwasher/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-01-01T22:59:00-08:00</published><updated>2017-01-01T22:59:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Ryan Buckley</name></author><id>tag:rbucks.com,2017-01-01:/2017/01/01/i-dont-have-a-dishwasher/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;About a year ago, my wife and bought a house.

Funny thing to spend so much time and money on buying a house… to discover it didn’t even come with a dishwasher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we didn’t sweat it then, and a year in, I don’t regret it now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, I’ve always liked washing dishes. Weird thing to say, I know. I like it much better than doing laundry. Dishes give me an immediate satisfaction. You go from high entropy to low entropy in a matter of minutes. Laundry just takes too long, and it’s not as satisfying since the machines do all the work. In fact, if we had a clothesline in our backyard I’d probably enjoy doing laundry more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a system down that I honed up at my family’s cabin where we also have survived for 80 years without a dishwasher. I rinse the largest dirty bowl, fill it up with warm, soapy water, and fill it with other dirty (but rinsed, quickly) items. Then I do a more thorough scrub in the soapy water, rinse off the suds using fresh water from the faucet, and place on the drying rack. When the drying rack is full, I bust out a dish towel and put them on the shelf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dirty to clean, disorganized to organized. It’s a beautiful thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to take dishwashers for granted. I don’t anymore. For centuries we’ve been using utensils and cookware that hasn’t gone through the magical germ-destroying electronic wash and rinse cycles and we somehow stayed healthy. That‘s what you worry about when not using a dishwasher, right? Cooties?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess I don’t really need one after all.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category><category term="personal"></category><category term="lifestyle"></category><category term="family"></category><category term="reflection"></category></entry><entry><title>Pinecrest buttermilk waffles</title><link href="https://rbucks.com/2016/09/18/pinecrest-buttermilk-waffles/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-09-18T07:52:00-07:00</published><updated>2016-09-18T07:52:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Ryan Buckley</name></author><id>tag:rbucks.com,2016-09-18:/2016/09/18/pinecrest-buttermilk-waffles/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h4&gt;Here’s my family’s secret recipe for buttermilk waffles&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dear internet, here is a treat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time, a long, long, time ago, a relative of mine brought a waffle iron up to (https://rbucks.com/2019/03/03/my-happy-place/) of the lake in Pinecrest, California. Not knowing what else to make with it, another relative of mine (my grandmother, I’m told), modified a buttermilk waffle recipe and posted it on the inside of a cabinet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every year for 34 years I’ve enjoyed these waffles. It’s the hallmark of my summer. I write now, dear internet, to share this goodness with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;!({static}/images/d3f90-17j231ywynawp08s-iwo4uq.jpeg)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there it has stayed since long before I was born. You can see the weathering on the scotch tape from decades of summers and winters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ingredients are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 7/8 cups of flour
2 cups buttermilk
2 teaspoons sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
4 tablespoons melted butter
2 eggs beaten&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I once tried to find the recipe online. It’s similar to a Betty Crocker recipe, but like I said, it got modified over the years. Perhaps for the higher elevation, perhaps for the crazy old waffle iron. I don’t know. But you’ll find that these waffles are perfect. Here’s the optimized instructions for how to make them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Put all of the dry ingredients into an ancient flour sifter. (You might check in the back of one of your cabinets, behind the navy beans and Quaker Oats). Sift into a large bowl until you have a nice fine powder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;!({static}/images/5c09f-1uijd2bcmab-zktpqa1-aba.jpeg)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add the buttermilk next. You can get some at the general store on the other side of the lake. Fold it in, don’t beat it. Beating your batter will make your waffles chewy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;!({static}/images/e02ab-1e_jxwwznao1r97pkkdnnpq.jpeg)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add the melted butter. Bacon grease works well too, especially if you have some already cooking behind you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;!({static}/images/826ad-1ck4vdwpihy_tr8twxec2zw.jpeg)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whisk your eggs into a froth. Hand egg beaters are an excellent choice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;!({static}/images/19a85-1urvsik6qza4tpbx-mzrt6g.jpeg)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fold in the eggs. Again, don’t over-mix or beat the batter. It’ll take several folds, but your batter is ready as soon as the golden egg froth disappears. Do this part slowly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set the stage. Melted butter is great for waffle iron preparation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;!({static}/images/38a05-1mbcwzsgfqg_2u5rucsejyq.jpeg)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your waffle batter should fall easily off of a spoon and form patty-like shapes on the waffle iron.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;!({static}/images/3621b-1xq8cvb6r7k8jahfqhee6na.jpeg)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enjoy, of course! You’ll get a feel for when the waffle is at a golden crisp. It just takes practice. Always eat with real butter and maple syrup. Never the fake stuff.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;!({static}/images/152e1-11-lqmplqcawncxcdsjqo3g.jpeg)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And share with people you love.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s a special place where life quiets and slows down. It’s the only place where I can very easily turn off the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s also a wonderful place to nap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naps are the most underrated adult activity. My days as a parent now revolve around nap schedules. Meals, errands, and playtime are timed by the nap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is napping only a province for toddlers? I hearby beckon the return of the nap!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benefits are many:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stay up later to get that extra reading or writing done- Sleep better when you decide to sleep for the night- Have a high energy afternoon, in which you’re happier and eat less- All the other regular benefits of sleep&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Napping at work is a taboo. The mid afternoon doldrums hit and instead of napping, I go for a walk, often to get a coffee. Napping for 30 mins would yield better results, but I can’t nap while my colleagues work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I’ll have to wait until my office days are over. Then I’ll nap the same time my kids do, and it will be glorious.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category><category term="personal"></category><category term="lifestyle"></category><category term="reflection"></category><category term="family"></category><category term="vacation"></category></entry><entry><title>Little Don</title><link href="https://rbucks.com/2016/07/27/little-don/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-07-27T05:46:00-07:00</published><updated>2016-07-27T05:46:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Ryan Buckley</name></author><id>tag:rbucks.com,2016-07-27:/2016/07/27/little-don/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s a speech I wish someone would have given at the 2016 DNC convention.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Republicans are now a party in shambles. They’ve splintered, and the leaders of the party have no clue how it happened or how to fix it. &lt;strong&gt;They spent the last eight years crying wolf, and then a wolf took control.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They’ve nominated the most shady person in the history of American politics to be president of the United States. Nice going, Republicans. What a historic screw up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Democrats ran a long but constructive nomination process, culminating in the first woman to be nominated for president by a major party. Hillary Clinton has served her entire life in public office. She was a senator, a cabinet member, and the First Lady to one of our great presidents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can’t think of a better resume to take the Oval Office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, there’s nothing presidential about someone born into wealth who uses his wealth to gain attention and bully people around who have less wealth than he does, so that he can make more money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been told to confront people like this head on. So I’ll do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Little Don, let me tell you something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know as much about world politics as my chocolate lab, Blue. If you wanted to be president, you should have  &lt;em&gt;listened to father and attended your private history lessons in the east study room with Sir Henry, your private history tutor&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Little Don, that’s not good enough.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’re not a blue-collar billionaire. That makes no sense. In fact, there’s a silver spoon stuck so far up your ass, it’s tarnished your hair color.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Little Don, that’s not good enough.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ve never held public office, so you’ve never written a bill or voted on legislation. Now you want to be executive of the most powerful government in the world. You’re a contestant on &lt;em&gt;The Bachelor&lt;/em&gt; applying to be the CEO of the American Broadcasting Company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Little Don, that’s not good enough.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You cheat on your wives and treat them like a car lease: “It’s been three years, time to upgrade to a younger model.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Little Don, that’s not good enough.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, it’s not good enough. The Republicans deserved better. Hillary deserves a better opponent. One who will elevate the discourse, not take it down into the gutter, which will become the next phase of this election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mrs. Clinton, I give you permission to meet Little Don there. It is beneath you, but what is further beneath you is losing this fight because our electorate rewarded Little Don for playing in the dirt, like the little boy he is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t use surrogates to deliver the biggest blows. Show that you can dish it as well as any alley-fighting man. Then when you’re elected president, wash it off. You’ll never need to stoop that low again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immigration and trade deals are not the biggest problems we face right now, not even close. For the next president of the United States, the focus will need to be on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A weakened Europe&lt;/strong&gt;. Brexit must be contained, because if it’s not, a chain reaction of economic downturn and political fallout will turn Europe back into an early 20th century powder keg.- 
&lt;strong&gt;A warmer climate&lt;/strong&gt;. It’s already been reported that the last 12 months have been the hottest ever recorded globally. This will impact food and water for hundreds of millions of people. That in turn will create radicalization and wars. Presidents care about climate change not because of the birds and the trees. They care because of war and famine.- 
&lt;strong&gt;An even stronger America&lt;/strong&gt;. Our stock markets hit another local high recently. Our companies are still the largest and most innovative in the world. But America needs to continue to fix health care, to put new focus on education and infrastructure. Korea should not have faster internet service than us. Canada should not have better health services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are in no particular order. Building a wall with Mexico and screening out Muslims from our borders is Breitbart bullshit, plain and simple. There’s no benefit to us from doing this. Although liberals complain about trade deals too, nationalism to this degree is also destructive. Innovation has costs as well as benefits. The economic specialization of nations will continue to evolve, and we can’t be protectionist with our jobs. That’s short-term thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good president will keep open trade channels and help the impacted Americans get new jobs. That should be the American way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Little Don will disappear into the annals of electoral history. He will be a scar on the Republican party from the year when the Democrats again made history by nominating the first woman president.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t like performing enough, and I didn’t really try to learn to like it. Still, I’m a guitar player, and a pretty darn good one when I’m warmed up and practiced. I like to wonder what it would be like to perform in arenas with a kick-ass rock and roll band. It’s very much a part of who I am, what I like to do, and what I think about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, some people can recall exactly where they were when Lennon and Kennedy were shot. I recall exactly where I was and what I was doing the first time I heard “(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1W2UddURXI)” by John Mayer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was driving north on the 880 in the East Bay, just up from the Oakland Airport. I had KFOG, a mellow rock station, on the radio, which I listen to in the car when nothing else is good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The song started. I heard the acoustic intro, a jazzy chord voicing that I didn’t recognize. Usually when I hear a guitar chord I can picture exactly where on the neck it is played. This time I couldn’t, and I was intrigued. A pop song with a complex guitar chord. Tell me more!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His voice enters with the drum kit and bass. He sounds young, and also unique. I figured he was about my age, maybe a little older. As the verse continued I couldn’t make out the chord changes. Was it just a couple notes changing, or was his entire hand moving around the neck? How many chord changes per verse? I couldn’t tell. Usually overly complex chords mean the musician is trying too hard, but this song felt seamless, and the melody line fit the chords really well, despite their complexity. The pre-chorus and chorus had the same affect. Simple, interesting, just kinda perfect. I could tell he was a bad ass guitar player but he also had the sense not to rip into a guitar solo and spoil the vibe of the song. They put a keyboard break in instead. Smart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Damn, who the hell is this kid?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tabloids have given John Mayer a rough time, and a lot of that is self-inflicted. However, as a musician and a guitar player, the guy stands out among the best. I’m not impressed by the technical extremists like (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw74sDWPH7U) and (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS_IYe5JTZ4). I never really cared for those players who overly romanticize guitar solos. I don’t like songs that sound like a music theory thesis project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I admire guitarists whose solos you can sing, who develop real voices in the way they play. I can pick out a solo (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q7Vr3yQYWQ), (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJx5626euOo), (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtLwuPCUEdg), or (http://slash%20november%20rain%20solo) just by listening to the way they strike the string. It’s distinct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t yet put John Mayer on the same level as those guitarists, but I give him a lot of credit for defining a style of guitar ballad that I’m not sure existed before him. Listen to “(https://g.co/kgs/xtWxH)” from that same debut pop album, “(https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Room_for_Squares).” Then listen to it again. Those guitar chords don’t exist anywhere else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For that alone, I give the man props, but I also respect his later work. The jazz trio, the country pop album, the Hendrix and Petty covers. I feel like if I was John Mayer, I’d have had the exact same guitar playing career. Oh, and dating Katy Perry? Sure, that too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the last decade of my life, since I’ve been aware of the guy, there’s been a thread in my brain that feels like I missed out on being John Mayer. The other threads remind me that I don’t have his voice, the guitar chops, the poise on stage, the libido. I would be a terrible John Mayer, and if I could get into his head for a moment, I bet there’s a thread there that wishes he could just have a (https://rbucks.com/2016/03/22/an-ode-to-the-suburbs/) with a hot wife and a couple of guitars hanging on the wall (like I do). Screw the fame. Simplicity, anonymity, and peaceful easy feeling is priceless. I’m sure he has those moments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s fun to think about, and I enjoyed my brief time in the spotlight with (https://twitter.com/stephmarco/status/475511293395603456). Plus, I’ll always be able to pick up my guitar and sing John Mayer tunes to Lily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;!({static}/images/10e40-1r3svmkllnh55ty3fv3mslw.jpeg)
&lt;em&gt;My Eames&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s my (http://www.hermanmiller.com/products/seating/lounge-seating/eames-lounge-chair-and-ottoman.html), and I just goddamn love it. It’s one of the things I looked forward to about owning a house. The justification was easy: when you spend your life savings on owning property in the Bay Area, what’s another few grand for a chair no one actually needs?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That and the fact that I’d mentioned it many times to my wife over the years was enough justification to make the purchase. I think it was delivered within two weeks of us moving in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The look is iconic, and it’s as comfortable as it is beautiful. The wide, low armrest makes it great for laptop-ing, which can’t be said for most lounge chairs. The ottoman cushion is actually the same design as the seat cushion, allowing them to be swapped in order to even out the wear, effectively doubling the cushion life. The swivel is completely smooth and silent, and that low lean that it’s known for makes you feel like you’re sitting in the cockpit of a Formula One race car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can I actually justify spending this much on a chair? Can anyone? Ultimately, that’s not the point. Money comes and goes. I don’t live to make money or to spend it. It’s fun to have nice things and to enjoy them with people I care about. It was equally fun before we could afford them. So what? I just like my Eames chair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, of course, Lily likes it too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like many companies, we have unspoken values. We like to hire scrappy people who enjoy working hard. They’re usually humble and don’t expect special treatment. You feel this humility when you walk into our office, and see it in the way we interact with each other. I’ve always been very proud of this. We have our own way of doing things, and most of the time there is consensus on the path forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, as we’ve grown, that consensus has been harder to find. We’ll have differing views on prospective job candidates, new and existing office perks, and our product roadmap. When we talked through these problems, we’d sometimes find ourselves talking in circles. We needed a rubric by which to evaluate our most difficult questions and answers. That rubric has become our seven company values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are our company values, in no particular order:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scrappiness- Passion- Intrinsic Motivation- Selflessness- Friendliness- Openness- Simplicity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Values create a common language that motivates and bonds us. Values shape and define our company culture, which means that they also impact our growth and productivity. These values that we’ve created and documented dictate how we run our company, and how we work with both clients and employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some ways that your own company values can be used in everyday workplace scenarios:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Hiring&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many employers believe in the old saying that you should trade 90 percent of employee talent for 10 percent of character. In other words, character and willingness to fit in with a corporate culture are even more valuable to a company than talent and experience. By using your company values as a guide, you can identify whether a prospective employee has the traits to fit in with the rest of your team. If passion and selflessness are part of your values, make sure that these characteristics are part of your hiring criteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Making Tough Decisions and Solving Problems&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Company values can help you make important decisions. When solving problems, values can remind you of your priorities and help you get back to basics when things get complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Spending&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re wondering how values can play a part in your company spending practices, consider the core meaning of a value like “scrappiness.” Scrappiness means that you’re willing to work in a low-frills environment that prizes concentration and focus over unnecessary distractions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Launching New Products&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Passion plays a huge part in launching new products or services. If you foster a company culture of passion and enthusiasm, it will be evident to your audience, and there’s nothing more infectious than enthusiasm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Marketing&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Values can play a huge part in your marketing campaigns. Consider this: If your company has a reputation for openness and honesty, then you’ve already gone a long way in establishing client trust. It starts with company culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Values are the glue that keeps us working together in the same direction, using a common language and motivating factors which we call our Scripted company values.&lt;/p&gt;
