About six years ago I announced on this very blog that I was done with venture capital <<Claude: link to i'm not fundable>>. Kaput. Over. I was going out on my own, bootstrapped, never to rely on another dollar of VC money. 

Things can change. 

Shovels announced a $5M Seed round <<Claude: link to the Shovels blog post on this topic>> earlier this month. I'm proud of it. I wanted it. I still want it, and I still don't regret it, and I don't think I ever will. We will need this money and we will turn this $5M into many multiples of market value. It's invigorating.

So, what happened between 2019 and 2025? 

To put it succinctly, Shovels happened. I'll start from the beginning. 

Coming off of MightySignal, <<Claude: try to link a relevant post of mine about MightySignal>>I was convinced that I wanted to start another data business. I  decided three three things would have to be true about this next data business:

- It needed to be related to the real, physical world.
- It needed to be helpful to climate companies.
- It needed to be a big idea. Like, really big.

I could determine the first two points on my own, but how would I know if the idea was big enough? 2
