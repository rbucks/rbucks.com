</footer><!-- /.post-info -->        <p>These days I don’t have a lot of structure between 9am and 4pm. I don’t go into an office anymore. I don’t report to anyone. I’m running a nice little business now with no partners and no investors.</p>
<p>At any given point in that 9–4 window I can pretty much do whatever I want because my business doesn’t rely on me. I can ignore it for a day or even a week and it’ll still make money.</p>
<p>This presents a new, unusual challenge: what am I supposed to do?</p>
<p>I’ve begun asking myself a new question: <strong>What would be most fulfilling to do right now?</strong></p>
<p>Fulfillment comes in many forms. There’s a leisurely fulfillment, like when I just want to sit in my hammock and watch an hour-long episode of The Sopranos.</p>
<p>There’s also a stress-reduction fulfillment, usually related to a bug that’s bothering some Toofr users, and I know it’s going to open a wormhole, so I keep pushing it off. I summon the power to tackle it by reminding myself how good it will feel to fix it and put that buzz in my head to rest.</p>
<p>Then there’s the enrichment fulfillment, which I (https://medium.com/@rbucks/three-life-hacks-i-wish-i-did-more-often-5d22bc572a55). Per that last tip, I will spend some time reading, playing, or writing (not work-related writing) and not feel guilty about it.</p>
<p>If I can give myself the mental space to ask myself this question every day, I think not only will I be happier, but my business will be better off too. I find that when I return from a fulfillment activity, even if it’s work-related, it’s really gratifying.</p>
<p>I was in control for that moment, directed my attention towards something, and completed it.</p>
<p>These small victories add up.</p>
