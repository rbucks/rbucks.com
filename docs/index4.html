<h2>Read: 3 books on Finance</h2>
<p>This quarter I managed to read three books as part of my self-improvement curriculum. In (https://rbucks.com/2019/02/06/my-personal-2018-recap/), I mentioned how I …</p></i>

                <i><p>If I could redo all of my content marketing, from every company I've ever worked on, I would keep this single, simple mantra in mind:</p>
