*This is my third article about thyroid cancer I was diagnosed with. The first two are *[My thyroid got cancer]({filename}my-thyroid-got-cancer.md)* and *[My thyroid got cancer: one year later]({filename}my-thyroid-got-cancer-one-year-later.md)*.*

Yesterday I got another ultrasound of my neck. Today I got a call from my doctor that the lymph node that the various doctors have been tracking for nearly two years now continues to be a concern. There's going to be more blood work, more appointments, more *blah*. 

I'm grateful for modern medicine but at the same time I wish it would all go away. This isn't an app or a loud TV show that I can just turn off. It's real life and every few months I have to think about it again and deal with it. 

Now is one of those times, and I'm frustrated about it. 

I think if I were twice as old as I am right now, I wouldn't care as much. Biopsies and doctors appointments are for old people, not for me. I'm 36, which I thought was "old" 20 years ago, but now I realize is still quite young.  I'm healthy. I exercise multiple times a week and I eat tons of salads. I don't drink excessively. I'm not stressed. 

Why do I have to deal with this cancer stuff? 

Yes, the "woe is me" refrain in my head during these moments is, put simply, "it's not fair." 

I know how it sounds and I don't like it. But if I'm honest with myself, that's how it feels. I can't deny my self-pity sometimes, and I indulge in it like a chocolate sundae. I know it's no good for me but it's a temporary reprieve from the reality that cancer doesn't care. There is no rhyme or reason or sense of fairness. 

Why me? Why *not* me? I don't know. Nobody does.

I was saddened to read about the *Top Chef* winner (https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/25/entertainment/fatima-ali-top-chef-dies/index.html) on January 25, 2019, from Ewing's sarcoma, a bone and soft tissue cancer. She was 29 years old and achieved incredible success in an extremely difficult field. Being a chef is crazy hard work, and breaking through before the age of 30 is basically impossible. She did it, and then she died. 

Now *that's* not fair. My condition is nowhere near as serious. People don't usually die from [papillary thyroid cancer]({filename}my-thyroid-got-cancer.md), so I have the data in my favor.  

I don't know what it feels like to have a serious, terminal cancer. I can relate only slightly, because each time I get an email or a phone call from my doctor after one of my tests, I get a flash of anxiety that I'm going to be told that my cancer is really serious. A pit forms in my stomach and I tune in really close to any changes in tone or fluctuation on the other end of the phone. I keep preparing to hear the worst but it hasn't happened. It probably won't, but I can't help the reaction. I don't think I'll ever get used to receiving my test results. 

The best thing I can do is what I imagine Fatima would tell somebody in my position. Enjoy the life and days I have. Anything could end it; don't take these healthy, happy days for granted. Don't spend time doing things I don't like to do. Invest in my health and the health of people around me. 

And yes, feeling sorry for myself with this mild cancer condition is a waste of time. Right now I actually have nothing to worry about. So I should stop worrying.
